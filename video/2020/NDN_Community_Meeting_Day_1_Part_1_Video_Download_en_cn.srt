222
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:39,343
the idea is you have data in different repositories, local storage, right?
这个想法是你有数据存放在不同的地方，比如本地存储，对吗？

223
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,472
And people want to keep their data as biologists for

a while before they publish.
以便在发布之前有一段时间。

225
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:47,910
And so things like findability, you can't find stuff on people's hard drives, right?
所以像可查找性这样的问题，你是找不到人们硬盘上的东西的，对吧？

226
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,770
Finding it in public databases is very doable.
在公共数据库中找到它是完全可行的。

227
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,090
Accessing it can be tricky, and I've been working with NCBI databases for
访问它可能有些棘手，我已经使用NCBI数据库工作了

228
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,080
25 years and I still don't quite understand their schema.
25年了，我仍然不太理解他们的架构。

229
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,675
So learning the tricks to be able to pull data is important.

230
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:06,624
Interoperability, a lot of genomics data is in common file formats and and

231
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,650
sometimes you have to preprocess it.
有时你需要对数据进行预处理。

232
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,599
We're putting a lot of preprocessed data into NDN, the NDN testbed.
我们正在将大量预处理过的数据放入NDN，即NDN测试平台。

233
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:17,232
And reusability is a lot of this data storage so
你可以重复使用这些数据存储，因为它们的可重用性很高。

234
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:21,808
you can go and reuse it, repurpose it for other purposes.
你可以去重复使用它，将其用于其他目的。

00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,426
And so we're trying to address all these problems with NDN, right?
我们正在尝试用NDN来解决所有这些问题，对吗？

236
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:29,280
Especially the accessibility part is abstracting all the metadata weirdness and
尤其是在可访问性方面，我们抽象出所有的元数据奇怪之处并且……

237
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,453
putting it into here so you can extract it with names.
将它放在这里，这样你就可以提取出带有名字的信息。

238
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:39,855
One thing cool about biology data is it's organized, well, biology is crazy, right?
生物学数据的一个酷炫之处在于它是有组织的，嗯，生物学本身就很疯狂，对吧？

239
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,490
It's like the craziest thing ever, like we were trying to explain biology.
它就像有史以来最疯狂的事情，就像我们在尝试解释生物学一样。

240
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,398
But if you organize data by evolutionary principles, it becomes actually rational.
但如果你按照进化原则来组织数据，它实际上就变得合乎逻辑了。

241
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:54,790
And so we actually have hierarchies of data sets from different species.
因此，我们实际上拥有来自不同物种的数据集的层级结构。

242
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,406
Like armadillos and humans are both animals, there's a common ancestor
像犰狳和人类都是动物，它们有一个共同的祖先。

243
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:02,160
thought to be from animals and humans 60 million years ago.
被认为是6000万年前动物和人类的。

00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,259
running around, probably sequence with genome too just for fun.
到处乱跑，可能还会为了好玩而研究一下基因组序列。

246
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,295
But we have relationships between the data sets, so
但我们的数据集之间存在关联性，所以

247
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,918
we can organize things by genus and species.
我们可以按属和种来组织事物。

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,340
And we have a naming convention for them.

255
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,850
I won't go into all the details, but we're actually processing all of these and
我不会详述所有细节，但我们实际上正在处理所有这些内容，并且

256
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,652
publishing them right now into one place of access, named access.
正在将它们发布到一个名为“访问”的统一访问点。

1030
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:09,310
data generated by the cars is an tremendous new issue.

And we all know there's a ton of data being generated on an hourly basis,
我们都知道，每小时都会产生大量的数据，

1032
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:20,030
those are the data we need to train our machine learning models to do things,
这些数据是我们需要用来训练我们的机器学习模型去做事情的。

1035
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,710
And we train machine learning models over there and

1036
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,810
that was sent the models back to the cars to use.
并将这些模型发送回汽车中使用。

1037
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:43,640
And sending those data to the cloud is getting more and more invisible.
并且将这些数据发送到云端变得越来越不显眼。

1038
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:49,801
So then the question is, did we explore other other capabilities?

1046
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,940
with the cloud?
与云端？

1047
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,296
So the cloud rather than collecting raw data from every cars,
所以云端不是从每辆车收集原始数据，

1048
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:25,842
can be collecting knowledge learned by the cars and transferred to the cloud.
而是收集车辆学到的知识，并将其传输到云端。

1049
01:15:25,842 --> 01:15:32,547

01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:53,590
transform, transporting data back and forth, we actually move to one step up.
我们实际上已经向前迈进了一步，不仅仅是来回传输数据。

1211
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:49,041
because the sheer amount of data you're generating and

1212
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:53,683
you can or you don't want to send them all into the cloud so
