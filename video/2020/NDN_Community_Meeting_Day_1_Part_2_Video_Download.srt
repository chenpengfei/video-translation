1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,020
Next we have session two on ICN for

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,494
wireless edge networking chaired
by Eve Schooler from Intel.

4
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:13,130
Eve, go ahead.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,205
>> Well,
we've got three great presentations today.

6
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:22,495
We're gonna lead off with one on
the topic of ICN when a program overview,

7
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:28,350
by Dr. Shree Katyayani Tsikata Suara,
otherwise known as Katyayani.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,540
Who's a senior research
scientist at Intel labs,

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,750
leading research in information
centric networks for edge computing.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,080
And her research focuses on applications
where ICN can add value to industry.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,921
Katyayani is the Intel PI for
the joint Intel-NSF ICN-WEN Center.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:51,727
Take it away Katyayani
>> Thank you so much Eve,

13
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:56,644
I'm starting to share my brain here.

14
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:04,215
Okay, so
I'll be just giving a brief overview of

15
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,840
the joint Intel-NSF ICN-WEN Center.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,110
It actually successfully recently
completed its three year tenure.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,540
And we have two other great
professors talking about it, but

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,450
I just wanna give a brief overview.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,680
So the idea,
when we set up this joint center with NSF.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,740
The idea was to explore what are some
of the potential of ICN especially

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,366
over wireless edge
networks in view of 5G and

22
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:42,280
5G+ or the new evolution of networks.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,843
And also when we have lot many more
devices and data at the edges,

24
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:52,493
we wanted to see what kind
of potential does ICN have.

25
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:58,490
What kind of solutions can it provide to
meet some of the more strict requirements?

26
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,000
Whether it's latency,
bandwidth, and so on.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,330
And we also wanted to look at more
realistic deployments or applications

28
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,820
typically used at the edges, whether it's
AR VR, autonomous driving, and so on.

29
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,210
And another important
aspect of the center was

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,620
that we wanted to look at
three pillars simultaneously.

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,390
That is, the wireless device endpoints,

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,800
the network infrastructure and
security and privacy.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,810
So we wanted security to
be part of the story,

34
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,370
part of the solution and
not an afterthought.

35
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,133
And I believe that the teams
actually did a great job doing that.

36
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:50,950
And we had three main projects
as part of this center.

37
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,020
The first few that I've listed here ISAR,

38
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,650
the hotbed UCLA and
SPLICE with the hobbit timer.

39
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,262
They used NDN and
the professors, Jeff Burke and

40
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:10,212
Trina Chakotay will be talking about it.

41
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:13,380
And I'll let them give you
all the wonderful details.

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,930
The third line LSN used, it did not
use NDN and use mumble at first.

43
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,354
And of course there were a total of
ten universities in the whole effort.

44
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:36,140
And we also had a great advisory
team that we put together.

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,420
We had a board of advisors, Geng Wu,
who I believe will be talking later today.

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,132
And of course Eve Schooler that you
all know, and also Udayan Mukherjee.

47
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:51,469
And we also had a couple of
external advisors, Dave Oran and

48
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,132
Christian Tschudin.

49
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,379
And all of them provided great feedback

50
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,900
guidance during this whole three years.

51
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,440
We also had a lot of support from NSF.

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,552
Darleen Fisher,
Monisha Ghosh Thyaga had started it off.

53
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:16,278
And also we had a good support system
with an Intel management team,

54
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:23,022
and also multiple Intel champions who
would attend the, we had monthly calls.

55
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:29,880
We had annual workshops and
also semiannual sort of virtual workshop.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,890
And it was great
interacting with the team.

57
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,700
At least I personally learned so much from
the center and from the interactions.

58
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,393
And in the last slide,

59
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:48,031
what I wanted to mention was a little
bit about our own learnings.

60
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:53,126
I know the professors talking right after
we'll be going over all the technical

61
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,550
details and learnings that they
gathered throughout the projects.

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,730
But I thought it might be more useful if
I talked about some of our own learnings

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,340
as Intel as a research lab.

64
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,564
When we try to go and
take these ICN solutions and

65
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:13,583
incorporate them into industry solutions.

66
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,410
And I thought that might be something
useful for everyone to hear.

67
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,395
So, one of the first things we learned is,

68
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:25,600
when you talk to somebody in
the business unit at Intel or

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,612
anywhere else in the industry.

70
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:33,317
The first thing that you'll see is they
compare ICN to existing systems and

71
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,390
not just TCP-IP or
TCP-IP with enhancements.

72
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,510
So if you say, I have a great solution for
caching or video distribution.

73
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,020
They'll say, okay, this is the latest and
greatest CDN that I have.

74
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,020
And not only just the CDN now, CDNs
are coming into the carrier networks and

75
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,600
putting them on the base station, okay?

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,410
How does it compare to that?

77
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,340
So that is a gap I felt that was
there in some of the typical

78
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,130
academic evaluations and
how industry looks at it.

79
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,898
And also a lot of times it's better
at least when we are looking at

80
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:14,068
solutions where ICN can
provide the biggest benefits.

81
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,226
It's where to go for

82
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:19,463
a place where there is no real solution
then offer just a better solution.

83
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,751
So that there is an area there is no real
solution industry is actually struggling

84
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,980
with it, and
then you say here I have the solution.

85
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,690
But when you do that, the other thing,

86
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,130
the question we get asked is, how does
it then integrate with existing systems?

87
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,108
So we believe that NDN has a lot of
potential in dynamic edge computing and

88
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,582
orchestration.

89
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:45,764
When you're trying to put
together your data, software and

90
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:50,602
hardware, trying to bring them
together in real time and do compute.

91
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:54,196
But when we started looking at that,
the first question we get asked is okay we

92
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,030
have Kubernetes we have this,
that and the other.

93
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,440
How does it compare with that?

94
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,256
So that is one of the first things you
have to do is look at existing systems.

95
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:07,120
And even if we have a great solution,
either it has to somehow coexist with it,

96
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,900
interface with it.

97
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,740
So in my opinion,
the NDN community can make

98
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,770
much bigger impact, if you start
looking at these sort of verticals or

99
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,580
solutions to solve specific problems and
say, this is how we can do it.

100
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,200
Now, you don't need to develop
a full commercial solutions.

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
But even if you take an abstraction and
say,

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
this is how typically they
are done in some example system.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,860
And this is how we can
interface with it or

104
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,050
this is how we can make it so much better.

105
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,060
So, that is kind of what I
wanted to leave you with and

106
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,210
sort of get you thinking on a topic.

107
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,940
And we also believe that when it comes
to dynamic composable edge computing,

108
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,920
there aren't many solutions out there.

109
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,080
And so it's a great area for
the community to develop more support,

110
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,210
and also enhance the support for
NDN over wireless.

111
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,670
Because when we started using any NDSM,

112
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,625
We found that there were a lot of things
that could be done better, for instance,

113
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,370
just creating dynamic faces,
deleting them and so on.

114
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,143
So this concludes my talk and
I wanted to leave you with some of these

115
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:19,760
points to think about and
I wanted to see if there any questions.

116
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,270
If not, Eve, I'll hand it back to you.

117
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,850
>> Okay.

118
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:41,350
Anybody out there who would
like to means a question?

119
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:51,813
>> Maybe what is the status
of the program today?

120
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:55,960
>> So we are in final stages
pretty much just winding down.

121
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,561
We had the final workshop in June
this year, so at this point,

122
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:07,395
pretty much tying up some loose ends and
that's pretty much it.

123
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:18,826
>> Catchavin can you speak to your
own interest in directions for

124
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:23,527
this work having been
exposed to these teams.

125
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:26,030
>> Great question and thank you Eve.

126
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,600
So as I eluded, one of the things and

127
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,500
it was, the last slide was
sort of related to that.

128
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,240
So of course, being an Intel and

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,750
also looking at the, where we believe
that there's a lot of potential for

130
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,110
NDN is in dynamic networks and
for compute.

131
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,267
I know NDN was traditionally developed for
data over fixed networks, but

132
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:53,423
at least if we want to bring these
solutions into industry, there are a lot

133
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:58,434
of gaps that need to be filled, NDN or
otherwise gaps need to be filled.

134
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,930
There are so many devices,
compute at the edges.

135
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,504
Data being generated at the edges,
also resources at the edges.

136
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,690
So, we're no longer limited to just
the infrastructure having resources.

137
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,780
Resources can be anywhere,
it can be a zeon in a car.

138
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,730
It can be a laptop in a user's home or
a PC and so on.

139
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,820
How do we bring all of these
into the fold of edge computing?

140
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,670
And I believe NDN has
a lot of potential there.

141
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,728
So I would definitely encourage the
community as well to look more into it.

142
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:34,197
>> We have a question here.

143
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:35,488
>> Yes?

144
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:38,855
>> I was just going to read it,
from Kathy Nichols.

145
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,535
Do you have a list of
your top applications

146
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
that could use dynamic
composable solutions?

147
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,379
>> I think yeah, I think it is as the, at
some instance as the question says itself.

148
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,690
The applications in our mind
that typically need that and

149
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm sure there are more, it would be
great for everyone to think about it.

150
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,760
Typically of course, anything is
related to smart transportation.

151
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,523
It has mobility, it has wireless,
it has mobile resources and so on,

152
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:09,452
our smart factory, cloud gaming, ARVR.

153
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:13,606
So these are some of the things that come
to mind, but I'm sure if you think about

154
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,830
it, there may be others that
you can come up with as well.

155
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,564
It's just that,
if they have the competence of dynamism,

156
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:22,573
whether the network's changing,
whether there's wireless,

157
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,660
whether there's mobility, just think of.

158
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,233
And then along with some
strict latency requirements,

159
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:31,053
it provides a great
combination in my mind.

160
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,001
>> Okay, any further questions?

161
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:49,930
Okay, well thank you very much,
Kathyayani.

162
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,430
>> Thank you.

163
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:59,263
We have a second talk or
second presentation.

164
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:02,208
I'd like to introduce
the topic is on SPLICE,

165
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:06,363
Secure Predictively Low-Latency
Information Centric Edge for

166
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,791
next generation wireless networks.

167
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:14,538
And the presentation will be given
by Srinivas Shakkottai, who in 2007

168
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:19,947
received his PhD from the University
of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

169
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,020
And he was a postdoctoral
scholar at Stanford.

170
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,396
He currently is a professor at Texas A&M
University in the Department of Electrical

171
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,882
and Computer Engineering.

172
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,336
And his research interests include
caching content distribution,

173
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,254
network markets,
multi agent learning and game theory,

174
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,859
wireless networks, reinforcement learning,
as well as data collection and analytics.

175
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,365
Srinivas is the recipient, oops,
somebody's typing very loudly.

176
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:48,340
Srinivas is the recipient of
a Defense Threat Reduction agency young

177
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,130
Investigator Award, and

178
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,400
NSF Career Award, as well as research
awards from Cisco and Google.

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,659
And a taboo, he also was received
several other awards including

180
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,080
an outstanding professor award and
an engineering genesis award.

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,510
Srinivas, it's all yours.

182
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,230
>> Thank you,
thank you all for being here.

183
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,182
So, I'll try to keep
it reasonably concise.

184
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:16,452
This is actually the combination of three
years of research by several universities,

185
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,180
several researchers.

186
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,002
So SPLICE stands for, Secure Predictive
Low-Latency Information Centric Edge.

187
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:26,370
And the goal was to work it
into next generation wireless.

188
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,590
So that's the kind of ultimate aim.

189
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,418
So this project was across multiple
universities, five of them.

190
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:38,380
From Texas A&M, P R Kumar, and
I'm giving this talk essentially for him.

191
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,685
So there's Kumar, myself,
and I-H.Hou from Texas A&M.

192
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:45,403
There's Shroff and
Attila Errol Masse from Ohio State,

193
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:49,586
Rheumatoid Charles Murray from Illinois,
Alisa Bertino, and

194
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:54,018
Charlie Hu from Purdue, and
Patrick Rowley from WashU St. Louis.

195
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:55,869
So if you look at this team,

196
00:13:55,869 --> 00:14:00,375
we are composed of folks doing
wireless security scheduling, and

197
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:06,110
Patrick going in was the only person
strongly invested in NDN specifically.

198
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,640
And so, this has been a good deal
of a learning experience for

199
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,020
the rest of us as well.

200
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,080
Because we went in thinking
that NDN as a very interesting

201
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,020
kind of scheme of things, but with little
experience with actually working with it.

202
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,822
And when we came away, we were kind of
solidly invested in the functionalities

203
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,913
deploys, as well as being able to
contribute to its enhancement.

204
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,282
So what was the point of this project?

205
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:31,890
Our goal was when we went in,

206
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,921
we were trying to understand what is
a worthwhile kind of application?

207
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,972
Containing, alluded to this as well,
what is a worthwhile application at

208
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:43,540
the wireless edge which doesn't
exist today in some sense?

209
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,730
And which is kind of very
clearly obvious going forward.

210
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,320
And we were kind of
thinking about applications

211
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,910
in that you're doing control of
systems over wireless networks.

212
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,670
So in many of these control systems,

213
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,910
what you wish to do is kind of
reconstruct a physical or virtual theme.

214
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,153
For example,
if you think about autonomous vehicles,

215
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,363
you have some vehicles with Lidar,
some with cameras, some with radar, etc.

216
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,169
And what the vehicles are interested in
is an abstraction of the physical field,

217
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,510
what is located where,
where are roads, people bicycles, etc.

218
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,924
So you're interested in reconstructing a
physical dynamic field at all these nodes

219
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:22,422
and then they wish to
take some control action.

220
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,205
Similarly, if you think of virtual
reality, we were thinking specifically of

221
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:30,270
virtual reality multiplayer gaming,
in which again, you have a virtual field.

222
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,150
You've got all these monsters and
walls and etc, all happening.

223
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,075
You're events which are going
on which is who is where,

224
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,555
who is shooting at what, etc.

225
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:41,005
Or if it's a driving game,
where these vehicles are moving, etc.

226
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,685
And that virtual field
needs to be reconstructed

227
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:47,123
with minimal delay at all the agents,
the game players in question, right?

228
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,020
In both these if you think about it,
there is a good deal of commonality,

229
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,380
you want a similar reconstruction at all
these agents in terms of the field and

230
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,970
what the things are where.

231
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,450
So there is a good deal of correlation
across user information requirements.

232
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,034
And so what really the user or

233
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:08,700
the application really wants is to focus
on extracting the desired information.

234
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,922
For example, in virtual reality,
there is a so

235
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,157
called motion to photon
latency requirement.

236
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,068
In the sense that to move your head,

237
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:19,092
you need a different viewpoint within
roughly 12 to 15 milliseconds.

238
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:22,844
So that's pretty strict,
because within that that time duration,

239
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,496
you need to kind of identify
what the user wants,

240
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:28,940
to render that particular viewpoint,
shift that viewpoint.

241
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,340
If you're doing wirelessly, the viewpoint,
the information corresponding to it, has

242
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,515
to wind up at the user headset, it has to
be uncompressed and displayed to the user.

243
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:42,530
And if you increase the latency,
user start getting nauseated, etc.

244
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,226
Which is why really, when you look at the
systems like Oculus, they have got a big

245
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:52,084
rendering engine, a big edge compute box
sitting in your living room or wherever.

246
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:56,552
And you've got a cable connecting the
headset to the box so that you have very,

247
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:57,646
very low latency.

248
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:01,722
Now if you want to cut that cable,
if you want to make everything wireless,

249
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:06,253
that imposes quite a lot of constrictions
on the information requirement as well as

250
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:07,954
the wireless network itself.

251
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:12,060
Which is why we are focusing on
controllable wireless delivery modalities.

252
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,550
How do we change
the wireless network itself?

253
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,496
Primarily we'll be focusing
on MAC scheduling algorithms,

254
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:20,788
keeping application performance and
definitely security in mind.

255
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:21,842
In terms of security,

256
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:25,009
we were interested in the wireless
angle in terms of connectivity.

257
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,211
As well as the information angle in terms
of encryption decryption in the NDN

258
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:29,815
context.

259
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,905
So in that context, we were trying
to build a kind of system from

260
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:38,011
the ground up in which we can
essentially control every layer.

261
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:42,147
Ideally using a combination of kind
of custom software and hardware.

262
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:45,193
So if you look at the lowest layer here,
the blue one,

263
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:47,305
it is basically the wireless angle.

264
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:51,595
So what we've got there is a software
defined radio in which we have full access

265
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,860
to the complete fine MAC, right?

266
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,575
And going up into the network stack,

267
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,794
you have the host machine in which
you have the network stack as well.

268
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:03,249
So in other words, these USRPs are the
software defined radios connected to

269
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,851
a kind of a controllerless scheme of
things which is based on LabVIEW, right?

270
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:13,197
And in which we basically can do MAC
based changes in MAC scheduling etc.

271
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,731
And we connected up this
UDP indicator there,

272
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:22,175
is a local connection within a machine,
it's not a TCP IP over the air.

273
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:25,897
It is only UDP within to connect
LabVIEW to the local host.

274
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,620
And then onwards we have the NFD stack and
the applications.

275
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,362
So essentially what this is, if you will,
is a kind of pure or semi pure information

276
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:40,711
centric architecture wherein TCP IP
is actually not even required, right?

277
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,238
As I said, we use that UDP for

278
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,955
a local connection because LabVIEW
is capable of local UDP sockets.

279
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:51,313
But the end to end from the server to the
client is not a TCP IP connection at all.

280
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,760
The only thing which is
connecting them are MAC IDs.

281
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,060
So the USRP uses a MAC ID and
the other USRP uses this MAC ID

282
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,910
to determine where it is coming from and
who it is destined for.

283
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,810
So that's our general architecture.

284
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,026
And I want to spend the next few
minutes discussing what we attained or

285
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,916
what are the goals of each level of this.

286
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:14,443
And how we kind of went towards this
ultimate goal of field reconstruction and

287
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,216
control.

288
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,230
So if you look at this bottom most layer,

289
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,230
the question is can we use an off
the shelf wireless communication scheme?

290
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,390
For example, there is WiFi,
which is essentially based on

291
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,030
carrier sense multiple access back offs,
so distributed.

292
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,950
And LTE which is more scheduled.

293
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,260
Now if you want to attend latency
guarantees, recollect this business of

294
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,170
virtual reality requiring about 15 or
so milliseconds latency.

295
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,458
Essentially, we calculated that
if you need that kind of latency,

296
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:45,436
the rendering is going to take quite a
while, roughly four or five milliseconds,

297
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,892
then there's compression.

298
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:50,155
It turns out that the wireless angle,
the one half wireless,

299
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,370
you have about two ish milliseconds,
maybe three.

300
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,850
So essentially we needed a scheme wherein
we can guarantee per packet latencies

301
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,790
of less than two to three milliseconds,
right?

302
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,340
Now the problem with WiFi is, given the
critical flows exists because it's CSMA,

303
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,390
you have no guarantee whatsoever.

304
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,830
If you look at LTE 4G, basically,
the frame length is ten milliseconds.

305
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,233
But the problem is,
when you transmit a packet,

306
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,460
the ack comes back either
as a bundled ack, or

307
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,407
you have to schedule the ack, which is
seven milliseconds away at the minimum.

308
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:22,967
So in other words, LTE is not capable
of this low latency kind of scheme.

309
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:27,508
And remember, when we were doing
this 5G was in its infancy.

310
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:32,349
Indeed, even now, 5G deployments with
ultra low latency are fairly minimal.

311
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:34,881
So essentially what we were looking for

312
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:39,188
was our own custom NDN friendly
ultra low latency scheme, right?

313
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:43,620
And so the edge of information
has to decide to do this idea.

314
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,290
That essentially we are doing
field reconstruction.

315
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,690
And the value of the field is as
good as how it represents reality.

316
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,680
So if you're looking at autonomous
driving, if a certain object has moved and

317
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,620
you don't know about it, well your field,

318
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,300
your perception of reality is
different from reality itself.

319
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,830
And this difference between reality and

320
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,720
your perception of it is
the edge of information.

321
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,712
So you want to minimize
this edge of information.

322
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:08,797
This applies even in
virtual reality regime,

323
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:12,430
in the sense that there is a monster
in front of you or next to you, etc.

324
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,090
Where is the monster as far as
the canonical virtual world is concerned

325
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,100
versus where is it with respect to where
you are, I mean, your perception of it?

326
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,390
So you want to minimize that that
difference in perception, right?.

327
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,390
Now we said that there are multiple users
and so there's correlation across them.

328
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,947
So we wanted to build in some
level of multicast support.

329
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:37,010
And indeed NDN awareness in the sense
that we need to tie this in into NDN.

330
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,200
So that the NDN packets that are issued,
requests, interest packets and

331
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,220
the responses etc are kind of cleanly
integrated into the wireless layer.

332
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,792
So that they can reveal in some sense what
their latency requirements are etc, and

333
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,791
we can integrate it and support it.

334
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,834
So I'm gonna give you one slide
on one of the major results.

335
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:59,045
So essentially, the very first one
is what I'm going to talk about.

336
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:04,247
In which way we instantiated, we developed
delay scheduling algorithms which

337
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:09,307
maximize the delay sensitive throughput,
we call this timely throughput.

338
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,600
And we basically actually
instantiated it on USRPs.

339
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,423
After that there were several papers
on actually integrating it into various

340
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,300
regimes.

341
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,210
And the last one was actually that since
we had this platform where we could

342
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,973
control the system at various different
layers, we actually built a RL platform,

343
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:29,230
a reinforcement learning platform
to do auto configuration.

344
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,370
So that was the very end of this,
which appeared last year.

345
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,940
But I just want to tell you
about the capacity region,

346
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,070
I think,
by our low latency scheduling algorithms.

347
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,500
So what this diagram shows is basically
the real time versus the non real time.

348
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,340
Traffic supportable simultaneously by
a wireless channel of 20 megahertz, right.

349
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,167
So the leftmost one is
our scheduling scheme.

350
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:55,348
Wherein you notice that it
attains the full convex region.

351
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:59,710
Whereas other schemes such as just longest
few first, max weight basically, or

352
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,803
random policies or
round robin etc are unable to attain.

353
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:07,424
So basically, we're able to show that
analytically valuable kind of takeaways in

354
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:11,463
terms of the scheduling algorithms
actually have an impact in reality.

355
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:15,886
You're able to support
a larger region of operations.

356
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:20,515
Now, moving up to the NDN
scheme of things and caching.

357
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:24,211
Essentially our our thought
process with the NDN was that

358
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:28,061
one big advantage that NDN
provides is information reuse.

359
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:33,042
That is it is cached at multiple locations
in the content stores that are available.

360
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,019
And so essentially can be utilized, one,

361
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:40,749
this this kind of stream of names
going by because you see the names.

362
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:45,007
Can you predict what name will
be requested next essentially by

363
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,671
multiple streams as these names go by?

364
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:51,274
And can you therefore determine in
advance what might be requested and

365
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:52,382
cache it in advance?

366
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:55,053
Now of course NDN is opportunistic,
we want it to be and

367
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,096
make it basically predictable, right?

368
00:23:57,096 --> 00:24:01,610
So the scheme of things they were we
wanted to have a way of doing proactive

369
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,830
requesting.

370
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,210
We needed to build this into NDN.

371
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,430
So we had some NFD modifications
to allow this to happen.

372
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,660
And furthermore, we wanted to actually
provide latency guarantees via smart

373
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,240
caching algorithms which can actually
prefetch the items which are needed.

374
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,730
Again we need wireless awareness
because the link may be lossy, etc.

375
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,180
So identifying which links to focus on for

376
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,500
such predictions and how much you can do
prediction versus opportunistic, etc.

377
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,510
Are questions which we have to deal
with with respect to the wireless link.

378
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,255
So in this context,
we had a whole bunch of work.

379
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:41,690
The first three are more related
to NFD modifications, our

380
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,420
own kind of flavor of NFD, which basically
allows you to kind of prerequest stuff.

381
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,305
Because if you think about it,

382
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:53,150
NFD by itself is not really issuing
interests of its own, right.

383
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,300
And so what we did was we basically stuck
in an algorithm as it were a small module,

384
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,850
which looks at the stream
of interest going by, and

385
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,510
issues interest natively from NFT itself.

386
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,080
So that these interest when
they're satisfied will come and

387
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,400
sit in the caching,
the content store of the loaded question.

388
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,990
And so are available closer to the end
user even before the end user actually

389
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,500
issues of interest.

390
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,360
So, essentially we worked
on proactive requests.

391
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,340
This was mostly focused
on by the folks at washu.

392
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,820
Then we use some of these ideas for
enabling these predictive requests,

393
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,020
as I said to NFD modifications.

394
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,740
Another strain of thought was, if you're
really interested in low latency,

395
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,890
perhaps the NFD forwarding scheme
of things needs optimization.

396
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,840
And so,
some folks actually worked on that kind of

397
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,300
evaluating different forwarding schemes
including hardware based forwarding.

398
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,790
In order to reduce the latency
of NDN Forwarding,

399
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,780
specifically when you scale up to
larger amounts of traffic, right?

400
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,570
On the Caching side,

401
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,360
we had several fundamental results,
specifically based on unreliable channels.

402
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,720
We found several counterintuitive
results on when you should cache and

403
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,790
how much you should distribute
your cache memories.

404
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,800
So that's where I'll stop
with respect to this.

405
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,660
An implementation,
which we had to do with virtual reality.

406
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,395
This was integration of the whole system,
wherein you have the VR headset,

407
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:18,700
you have caches of NDN basically, as
well as the wireless channel underneath.

408
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,680
And this is not a video it's just a frame,
please.

409
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,480
Basically we were able to show I think you
should be able to see it on your screens.

410
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,510
The top left is with predictive, we are
able to support a much higher rate of high

411
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,010
resolution frames than the bottom right,
which is should look kind of grainy.

412
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,030
So you actually see this
as you play the game,

413
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,460
you can see that a good deal more
is at a much higher resolution,

414
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,500
you can pretty much make sure that
most of them are at high resolution.

415
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,320
Only a few will be at
the lower resolution.

416
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,470
So that was kind of so we were able to
improve the end user quality of experience

417
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,650
by tying in caching as
well as the wireless.

418
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,830
And so the final thing I
just mentioned the VR App,

419
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,420
the high level goal of VR App
in general was to cut the cord.

420
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,640
So when I began this talk I talked
about essentially Oculus, and

421
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,170
the fact that you need a cable between
the edge rendering box and your headset.

422
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,410
The goal was to actually eliminate
that via smart wireless scheduling and

423
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,310
prefetching.

424
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,467
So that via the use of NDN, basically for

425
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:26,120
this kind of communication, right.

426
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,850
Now finally, of course, we needed this
whole system to be secured by design.

427
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,960
So essentially, we needed the questions
of access control security and

428
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,350
information security.

429
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,452
And the information security,

430
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:41,120
the first two bullet points there,
indicate that we need latency guarantees.

431
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,990
Because we do not have infinite
time we only have about 14 or

432
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,470
so milliseconds before the next
frame shows up at the headset.

433
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,050
So, essentially the if we realized
we can't afford to spend two or

434
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,470
three milliseconds in
encryption decryption.

435
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,200
So, we wanted lightweight
encryption schemes, and

436
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,560
that was pretty much the focus
of Lisa Martino's group.

437
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,570
As well as looking at essentially access
control methods, she focused primarily

438
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,150
on LTE because we realize going forward
5G is going to be based on LTE.

439
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,190
And many of our scheduling
algorithms etcetera,

440
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,840
would have a natural
home in 5G in some sense.

441
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,770
Although as things have developed
over the past three years, it's

442
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,240
even Wi-Fi has moved towards a scheduling
based scheme, Wi-Fi 6 and so on.

443
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,250
I love scheduling, so it's kind of
interesting that both Wi-Fi and

444
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,090
LTE or 5G are moving strongly towards
the scheduled scheme of things as

445
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,090
opposed to random access.

446
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,810
So the main results
from the security side.

447
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,100
The first few all have to do with access
security, essentially looking for schemes,

448
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,340
which are kind of poorly developed with
respect to the security angle in LTE.

449
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,920
The latter few are related to essentially
signature schemes, encryption, decryption

450
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,180
and that's really what I want to focus
on as my kind of candidates slide.

451
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,881
So this basically indicates,
>> If you could surely fast if you could

452
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,570
wrap up shortly, that would be great.

453
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,290
>> I'm done with the last slide basically.

454
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,920
>> Okay.

455
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,160
>> Oops, sorry.

456
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,070
So essentially what we had, we wanted to
say that we had lightweight signature

457
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,390
schemes, wherein you can actually
encrypt decrypt much more quickly.

458
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,350
So I have a slide on that actual system
how it looked in terms of a access point,

459
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,560
and multiple hosts.

460
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,079
And finally, this has to do with a little
bit more on the system architecture, but

461
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,719
I'll wrap up there and say thank you.

462
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:31,654
>> Terrific, thank you.

463
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:32,795
Are there any questions?

464
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,510
>> It says somebody I need a highlight.

465
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,489
I don't want the paint.

466
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:47,120
>> I don't know what
the highlight is either [LAUGH].

467
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,510
But actually, can you tell us
where the work is going next?

468
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,600
>> So one aspect is we asked for
a no cost extension and

469
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,490
we got some funds from the power testbeds

470
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,440
to try out some of these ideas over
the air over reasonable ranges.

471
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,750
So we basically as far as this
extension to power is a platform for

472
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,280
advanced wireless research.

473
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,790
And what we're doing there is
working with the Utah test bed

474
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,440
wherein they have got USRPs and
SRSNT operating all of them.

475
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,615
Where we want to try out this combination
of low latency scheduling and

476
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:25,980
NDN with the idea that if you think of
things like autonomous vehicles and so on.

477
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,370
You are going to be operating them in
the field, with these long range links.

478
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,000
And the question was what kind of
performance gains can we get using NDN for

479
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,430
as a field reconstruction in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

480
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,105
That is one one train of
thought which is continuing.

481
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,200
This same idea we believe
is valuable also in

482
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,140
I think that was mentioned
in the last session as well.

483
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,245
Essentially, it looks like it's
the whole concept of ICN and

484
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:59,440
NDN specifically seems to be quite
valuable in the context of sharing

485
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,390
information with a lot of commonality
in the context of autonomous vehicles.

486
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:03,930
So that's

487
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,230
something which we think is valuable and
something to look forward too.

488
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,430
>> Thank you very much for your insights.

489
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,366
That was terrific.

490
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,375
>> Thank you.

491
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:18,970
>> Okay, we're gonna hand over the floor
to Jeff Burke, who's gonna speak to us.

492
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,170
He's going to give us an update on
ICN-Enabled Secure Edge Networking

493
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,150
with Augmented Reality the ICE-AR project.

494
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,260
And for
those of you who don't know him already,

495
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,310
Jeff Burke is a Professor in Residence
at the UCLA Department of Theater.

496
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,160
He co directs REMAP,
the Center for Research and

497
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,260
Engineering Medium Performance.

498
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,540
Joint Center of the UCLA School
of Theater, Film and

499
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,010
Television and
the Samueli School of Engineering.

500
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,890
REMAP has conducted application
research in NDN since 2010,

501
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,978
and Jeff is a COPI in
the NSF Intel Supported ICE-AR Program.

502
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,417
All yours, Jeff.

503
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,110
>> Great, thanks to you.

504
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,090
So this is collaborative work
by the PI's that are listed in

505
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,650
the bottom of this slide and
several of them are also on this call.

506
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,520
So at the end if you have questions,
they're here as well.

507
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:15,506
I am going to give a quick
overview of the ICE-AR program,

508
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:20,440
and talk a bit about
the lessons that we've learned.

509
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,279
And these are things that we've gone back
and forth internally on quite a bit,

510
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,442
both to share with Intel and
NSF, and now with you.

511
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:35,395
There are four research thrusts, one in
applications that really led to API and

512
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:39,546
library development as
a big part of the project

513
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:44,451
as we navigated what exactly
are applications needed.

514
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:49,508
One on security at the edge,
one on information-centric wireless,

515
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:54,050
so the impact of a data centric
NDN based approach on lower layer

516
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,239
wireless technology in this edge context.

517
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:00,348
And then the use of
acceleration as a service, and

518
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:03,974
all of these were driven by
the use of augmented reality and

519
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:08,710
layered mixed reality to drive
research on NDN at the wireless edge.

520
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,800
So on the website,
there is a significant amount of code and

521
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
more detailed publications.

522
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,660
I'm gonna go pretty quickly
through everything here.

523
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,280
And so there's a lot more of
a technical detail there.

524
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,913
So the original driver was
decentralized augmented reality.

525
00:33:23,913 --> 00:33:27,541
So the basic idea is that for
AR in the future,

526
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:31,850
we may move from applications
that are centralized.

527
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,920
And they're delivered in a stovepipe
context, both for the apps and

528
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,905
the content to a decentralized approach,
where individuals share their context,

529
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:43,910
things like location,
camera view, and so on.

530
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,872
And in return,
get content offers from many sources.

531
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:52,723
And that there are edge processing
nodes that participate in both

532
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:57,307
the calculation of the context or
figuring out a deeper notion

533
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:01,537
of context from the raw sensor
readings on the phone, and

534
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:07,260
also then delivering customized
content to an eventual AR experience.

535
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,765
And over the course of the project,
I think we shifted on the application side

536
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:16,200
to not only looking at AR, but really
looking at a more general shift in media

537
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,706
and experience and delivery from an old
model in which computation was kind of

538
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,717
isolated at each stage of
the production process.

539
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:28,593
From envisioning the media, to making it,
to delivering it, and experiencing it,

540
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:33,151
to really a realtime model that's inspired
by certainly the way the web works.

541
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:37,635
But also now, game engines, and
some of the realtime 3D rendering tools

542
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:40,963
that are influencing AR VR
cinematic production and so

543
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:45,811
on, which presents a lot of interesting
opportunities for edge computation,

544
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:49,980
in which media is customized
at the last possible moment.

545
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,570
So the first of the ICE-AR thrusts
was this application focus,

546
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,860
and I'm actually not gonna
discuss too much the AR and

547
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,718
MR integration tests that were really
driving our hands on experimentation.

548
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:06,750
And just wanna focus for
this presentation on four outcomes,

549
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,720
in terms of new APIs and
libraries for the community.

550
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,555
The first is called
the Common Name Library, NDN-CNL.

551
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:18,980
And this is a collection oriented API for
NDN that kind of moves one layer up

552
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,600
from the interest data exchange that
most of the existing APIs that handle.

553
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,379
And presents an alternative to a socket
based way of thinking that focuses on

554
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:33,350
name based collections as the API for
the application itself.

555
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,820
The second was a integration of
our previous work on realtime

556
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,800
video into a visual programming
language called touch designer.

557
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,966
This was called TouchNDN,
so you'll see a little

558
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:56,980
bit in the video that probably is
not playing very smoothly for you.

559
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,654
But you get a rough idea of his
visual programming environment for

560
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:01,900
experimenting with data centric media.

561
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,240
Then on the lower right is a stack
diagram for NDN-Lite, which is the latest

562
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,870
generation IoT framework kind of taking
into account the needs of both easy and

563
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:19,430
cross platform deployment of NDN for
IoT, and AR support context.

564
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,200
But also,

565
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,390
trying to build on a lot of IoT work
that's happened in the community before.

566
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,306
And then finally, some approaches to
remote procedure calls that would

567
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:31,655
be used to generalize the way
that we invoke remote services.

568
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:38,053
And some demonstration of how to modify
existing video codecs to take advantage

569
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:44,354
of NDNs consumer driven approach to being
able to select video both in space and

570
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:49,728
time at the level of an individual,
and the interest using names.

571
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:50,854
And of course,

572
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:56,932
we're looking at security as being built
into the applications into the network.

573
00:36:56,932 --> 00:37:01,737
But really, from an NDN research
point of view, focusing on continuing

574
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:06,640
the effort to dymatize security
relationships through the use of names.

575
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,940
And so there are several examples
listed on this slide that range from

576
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,930
new certificate schemes like Coalesce for
efficient shortlived keys on IoT,

577
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,950
to continued work on our
certificate infrastructure.

578
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,950
Do some applications of attribute
based cryptography that

579
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,690
provide a nice bridge between
what we can specify in a name,

580
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,380
in terms of the attributes
that might allow verification

581
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:44,400
of data with essentially policy in
a way baked into the ABS certificates,

582
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,250
to access control of that context
exchange that I mentioned earlier.

583
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,670
And looking also finally at availability,
and

584
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,690
how to handle DDoS in these circumstances.

585
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,530
So some of the security
APIs are on the call, and

586
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,640
I think might be interested in answering
detailed questions if you'd like to

587
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,610
know more about the security work, sorry.

588
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:17,160
And then the third area of research was
focused on the impact of an information,

589
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,370
or data centric way of thinking
on the wireless layer.

590
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,317
And if you think about NDNs intrinsic
multicast behavior, it's well suited for

591
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:28,880
wireless media, or at least,
it should be well suited for

592
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,514
a media that is intrinsically broadcast.

593
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:35,936
But the common implementations of WiFi
have been focused on unicast behavior.

594
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:41,221
So a lot of the effort in this thrust to
the project was to find ways to actually

595
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:46,426
take advantage and create high
performance link layer wireless multicast

596
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:51,780
that is leveraging the names that
are available in NDN interest and data.

597
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,122
And at the same time, to take further
advantage of those names to start doing

598
00:38:57,122 --> 00:39:02,311
runtime learning and reasoning about
different types of failure modes.

599
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:07,190
So both to look at the traffic patterns
based on the names themselves, but also,

600
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,085
things that can be encoded
in interest as well.

601
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:14,895
And so some of the experimental results
from the wireless group are listed below,

602
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:20,610
and include higher performance multicast,
improved application speeds for AR and VR.

603
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:25,244
And decreased packet loss in these
high performance multicast situations,

604
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:29,093
as well as some implementation
additions to Android WiFi direct

605
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:33,814
that were important to the future of
the applications that we were looking at.

606
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:40,329
And then finally, as a kinda key example
of an edge service well supported by NDN.

607
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:44,367
We looked at FPGA based
acceleration taking,

608
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:50,475
in this particular case, an interest
in trying to ingest at the edge,

609
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:56,065
low latency content from the camera
that's carried on a phone or

610
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:59,920
a headset, and go from unprocessed video.

611
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,590
That's something where there
was some deep context about

612
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,270
what was happening with
the human beings in the scene?

613
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,450
So we're interested in pose recognition
as an initial sort of basis for

614
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,320
understanding activity and human behavior.

615
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,883
>> And Jason Collins group at UCLA
worked on a novel FPGA acceleration

616
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:24,561
with low power, sort of a nice low
power and high frame rate result.

617
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:29,442
That was an example of what can then
be plugged into an acceleration

618
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:34,410
as a service model, leveraging
the work from Alicia Shanks group on

619
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,999
this remote procedure
call general mechanism.

620
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:43,458
So I'm gonna use just a few minutes now at
the end to talk about contributions and

621
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,772
lessons learned.

622
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:47,956
Maybe focusing a little
bit more on the lessons.

623
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:52,702
What we saw, we believe is a further
validation of the architecture and

624
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:56,985
its approach in benefiting these
wireless edge applications.

625
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:59,838
I wanna point out just
one thing in particular,

626
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,205
which is the middle bullet here on
the network computation and storage.

627
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:07,142
And I would add actually
content producers and

628
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:10,386
consumers as well are all
supplying the same data.

629
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:15,266
And so through seamless integration
into an ecosystem of new devices from

630
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:19,909
IoT to media and I think one place where
we saw that in a very concrete and

631
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:24,710
specific way in my are, which was
focusing on applications was suddenly

632
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,142
being able to look at video from
several different perspectives.

633
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:32,999
Was it a bus that we could tap into
a stream that we would receive in

634
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,214
a traditional way or

635
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:38,947
essentially part of the key value store
that really looked a lot like storage.

636
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:42,361
It actually didn't matter
how the video was produced,

637
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:47,082
but by having it in the NDN packet format
and on the network, we could use any of

638
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:51,803
those three approaches to access both
live and historical video as an example

639
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:56,548
of the sort of impact of the architecture
on how we think about applications.

640
00:41:56,548 --> 00:42:01,062
Also, the ICR project is definitely
deepened our team's understanding of

641
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:05,164
the impact of the network architecture
both upwards and downwards.

642
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:10,556
So impacting lower layer technologies
that are now optimized to support IP and

643
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:16,031
essentially point-to-point delivery
mechanism most of the time as well as,

644
00:42:16,031 --> 00:42:20,602
of course, the impact on upper layer
apps in terms of how they think

645
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:22,725
about moving content around,

646
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:27,983
making connections before they proceed
with exchanging content and so on.

647
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:34,930
Certainly there's impact in the middle and
on the approach to security, as well.

648
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:39,583
We saw I think from that impact on the
upper and lower layers, some challenges

649
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:44,464
that we hadn't really expected on
quantitative comparisons implementation.

650
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:49,409
So certainly there are some nice
performance results from the subareas that

651
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:52,577
I mentioned briefly in
the previous slides, but

652
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:57,135
a lot of those took far more
implementation effort than we'd expected

653
00:42:57,135 --> 00:43:02,156
to access lower layers in the protocol
stack or to modify the media formats and

654
00:43:02,156 --> 00:43:06,431
protocols that are intertwined and
increasingly complex ways.

655
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:11,808
Bacon assumptions and certainly to start
testing things in larger AR platforms and

656
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:13,726
game engines that are in, and

657
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:17,744
of themselves significant
software engineering projects.

658
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:22,394
So there was a lot, I think that we
learned about how to potentially

659
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:27,294
support this kind of experimentation
a little better in the future and

660
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:30,864
maybe lobby a bit for
more access to the hardware and

661
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:36,370
operating system functionality that's
needed to really demo NDN's value.

662
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,033
So one of the common
questions we got was well,

663
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,232
can't we use the same thing using IP?

664
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,174
And there are a few answers here.

665
00:43:43,174 --> 00:43:47,898
I won't go into all of them, but this is a
nice conversation that we might be able to

666
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:51,742
have in some of the panels over
the course of the next several days.

667
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:56,928
But then to wrap up here with a little
bit more on our sort of understanding

668
00:43:56,928 --> 00:44:02,725
is we were really looking for OS platforms
to allow deeper access to the network.

669
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:07,852
And so that's a place that we need
to maybe provide some support for

670
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,053
researchers.

671
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:13,789
Certainly we wanted to try to allow
applications to implement a data centric

672
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:16,749
paradigm directly in
the application design,

673
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:20,532
which was something that
the Indian CNL library tries to do.

674
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,947
And in cases where we can with
that type of library to allow

675
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:27,932
that data centric designed to also
operate at the network level and

676
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:32,772
provides something where there's not maybe
as much of a semantic gap between how

677
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:36,924
application designers are working,
and how the NDN network works.

678
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:42,370
And this is guiding us towards, hopefully
some future fruitful areas of focus.

679
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:45,613
We're not trying to change
everything all at once, but

680
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:50,102
work potentially bit by bit from the edge
focusing on plug and play behavior.

681
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:55,104
the NDN platform and greenfields
where a lot of this previous sort of

682
00:44:55,104 --> 00:45:00,473
the previous emphasis and optimizations
for IPR had less of a foothold.

683
00:45:00,473 --> 00:45:05,581
So some of the the future work is listed
here and happy to talk about any of that.

684
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:08,051
>> Yeah, maybe I'll take one
question if there is one.

685
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:12,327
If not, then maybe a final comment on the
most exciting future work as you see it.

686
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:16,393
Is there a question out there?

687
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:18,226
Thank you for a great presentation.

688
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:26,152
Okay, final thoughts on exciting future.

689
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:30,663
>> I can tell you the final thought
that's sort of the most exciting for

690
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:34,937
me which is plug and play sounds simple or
maybe simplistic, but

691
00:45:34,937 --> 00:45:39,845
I think the more that we can take this
experience in the last three years and

692
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:44,832
at each within each thrust look at ways
to get these tools into the hands of as

693
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:48,263
many researchers and
experimenters as possible.

694
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:52,813
That seems to be one of the most exciting
parts of the future work right now.

695
00:45:52,813 --> 00:45:56,673
>> And with that, you're focusing on
the ease of configurability, I think.

696
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:01,271
>> Ease of configurability, but
I think also trying to find ways to have

697
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:05,884
the API's present an easy to
understand data centric perspective.

698
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:12,062
So it's definitely making things work
as simply as possible to experiment,

699
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:18,430
but also trying to kind of help guide
applications to a data centric perspective

700
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:24,251
that allows them to take advantage
of the network behavior underneath.

701
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:28,018
>> Great, can the organisers tell us,

702
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,913
do we have time for one more question?

703
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:33,142
>> Don't think so leave.

704
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:34,970
>> Okay, we'll take it offline.

705
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,840
>> Thank you so much.

706
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,205
>> Thank you all.

707
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:41,798
>> Thank you very much.

708
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:45,435
The agenda has the next panel two, but

709
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:49,642
we have Ilya who missed
the big recession and

710
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:53,633
we will give him no more than ten minutes.

711
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:58,737
So we're delaying panel two no
more than ten minutes, Ilya.

712
00:46:58,737 --> 00:47:01,015
>> Okay, great.

713
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:04,370
So yes, thank you for
having me here today.

714
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:10,230
I think my presentation be somewhat out of
maybe not quite in context with everything

715
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,772
else that was discussed, because it's
not specific to Indian architecture.

716
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:20,190
So fabric is a midscale
research infrastructure.

717
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,153
Project funded last year before
years to build a nationwide

718
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:30,018
networking testbed that will
allow experimentation with

719
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:34,882
a variety of distributed,
verticals, applications and

720
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:39,844
architectures with a key idea
being that it is really kind of

721
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:45,126
time to look at potentially
putting more state in the network.

722
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:49,340
And what form that state might
take we as the builders of this

723
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,219
infrastructure try not to
have too much influence on,

724
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:58,730
rather just trying to create as many
options there for experimenters to try.

725
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,970
And of course, NDN architecture
is one example of an open new

726
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:11,010
internet architecture that has more
state that requires storage and

727
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,680
processing capabilities
out of the network.

728
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,680
But as I said, we ourselves as
the builders of this infrastructure,

729
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,430
try to remain neutral to
the various possibilities.

730
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:26,490
That should the computing
community has a chance to explore

731
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,030
these various inflection
points in the architecture and

732
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,140
then decide what works and what doesn't
at a reasonable level of scale.

733
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,610
So, just to briefly introduce
the leadership team has myself and

734
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,110
Nita Nicolaj from inner cylinder Urbana
Champaign in the manga is the executive

735
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,500
director of Department of
Energy's energy sciences network.

736
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,290
Jim Griffin from University of Kentucky,
Casey Wang from Clemson.

737
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:51,350
Tom layman, also Polo Roof and
Zong Ling, Fei.

738
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,070
So what is fabric?

739
00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:00,900
As I mentioned,
its goal to enable a new paradigm for

740
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,050
distributed protocols,
applications and architectures.

741
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,960
The intent is to build
a nationwide programmable network

742
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,190
with significant compute storage
capabilities at each node within the core,

743
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,330
not just at the edge, but in the core.

744
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,200
Such that you have a continuum now of
possibilities of where to put your storage

745
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,870
computation on data as it
travels through the network.

746
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:28,297
And the idea is that the computation can
be supported by a variety of augmented

747
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:33,403
computing devices like GPU like FPGAs,
network processors, etc etc.

748
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:37,477
Quality of Service is important from
repeatability, reproducibility of

749
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:41,547
experience point of view, we shouldn't
forget that this is a testbed, so

750
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:45,055
that's provided by dedicated
hundred gigabit optical links.

751
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:49,514
And then also the ideas of fabric
is not in itself a sandbox, but

752
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:54,399
rather in connects incentives to
interconnect other facilities HPC

753
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:59,536
centers cloud wireless test bits
Public clouds, commercial clouds and

754
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:04,166
a number of edge nodes such that
the experimenter can pick what her

755
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:08,880
kind of selection of resources is
within her global experiment and

756
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,471
you know, pick the ones that
are closest to what what she needs.

757
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:17,717
Rather than having to kind of reinvent
everything from scratch because fabric

758
00:50:17,717 --> 00:50:21,964
really can't and shouldn't try to
reproduce the entirety of the ecosystem of

759
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:25,589
computation on other resources
available to researchers today.

760
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,990
Instead it's producing.

761
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,930
It provides a separate way of
transporting data between those

762
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,500
while computing on it in flight,
essentially.

763
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,150
This is our idea of what the topology
will look like when it's completed.

764
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,430
Of course,
subject to change over the next few years.

765
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,060
We're at the end of year one of
the four year construction project.

766
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,570
All the blue links are dedicated
hundred gig capacity.

767
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,980
And then the yellow is what we
call this terabit super core.

768
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,610
This is where we plan to have
some version of a terabit network

769
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,890
either it's one terabit
1.2 terabit per second.

770
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,330
Of course, there are locations where
we will appear with public clouds using

771
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,930
internet to Cloud Connect system.

772
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,600
Such that, you can't really
think of an experiment and

773
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,140
infrastructure today that doesn't
include some version of a public cloud.

774
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,950
So obviously that's
that's a requirement and

775
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,380
then you can see also all the facilities,
at least the initial list of facilities,

776
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,170
we're going to connect Do you see
tag cloud love powder cosmos,

777
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:31,670
the Pittsburgh supercomputing center mgh,
PCC, etc, etc.

778
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,670
A little bit about the hardware.

779
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,710
So the whole idea is that we
want to interpose compute and

780
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,400
storage, different types of compute and

781
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,430
storage into the path of fast packet
flows that are right in the network.

782
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,090
So, you know, each site is a rack
of high performance servers,

783
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:54,100
dual dual CPU 32 core,
have half a terabyte

784
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,440
of RAM,
different flavors of servers in each site.

785
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,360
Some have loaded with GPUs,
some of FPGAs and network cards.

786
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,720
Storage of different tiers on

787
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,320
some experimental provisional NVMe drives
as well as rotating storage at each site.

788
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,280
And of course, everything connecting
with to a to a to a switch that has

789
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,050
different types of Port speeds
from 25 to 100 and above.

790
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,020
Gigabits per second.

791
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,600
FPGAs with support for P4, as is another
goal and then mellanox Connect X-5 and

792
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,550
6 family cards as kind of hardware offload
cards with OBS and things like that.

793
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,890
And then the idea is that the experimenter
essentially gets access to these devices.

794
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,910
Primarily the mode we envision is
using virtual machines with direct

795
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,640
attached PCI devices for
some high value experiments, we can see

796
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,580
dedicating entire servers to those and
provisioning them for that experiment.

797
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,030
However, given the kind of
the size of the facility,

798
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,484
the amount of resources at each site,

799
00:52:56,484 --> 00:53:01,850
we think that In order to make this a kind
of successful multi user facility, we have

800
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,246
to rely on some level of virtualization
to achieve a level of scale.

801
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:12,784
A typical experiment in fabric,
this is absolutely unrealistic but

802
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:17,935
it just sort of shows some of the ideas
as purposely Showing on top of a map of

803
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:23,087
the United States just to show the level
of this distributed capacity or,

804
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:28,571
you might connect some external resource
like, a cluster attack or SDSC, for

805
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:35,440
instance, and then maybe you're sampling
traffic that's going through this link.

806
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,390
And you're using an SSD
like an NVMe drive and

807
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,880
an FPGA to do some additional
processing on the data and

808
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,530
it's usually it's it's like
a bump in fiber or bump on wire.

809
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,290
Then maybe you want to build a virtual
switch out of these different

810
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,970
network cards, some of them perhaps.

811
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,720
With the four capabilities,
some of them just kind of OBS, or

812
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,120
maybe you're hosting an application within
the network that uses GPUs, and again,

813
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,570
maybe fast drives for
caching data, things like that.

814
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:07,640
And we also have room for
a small number of dedicated p for

815
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,500
switches if you really want very,
very high port counts for density.

816
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,910
Comparatively high port density in a few
locations, you could also do that.

817
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:22,010
Yeah, this was kind of a conceptual
idea of what a fabric now it looks like.

818
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,660
There's a head node or

819
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,460
something that will workers equipped with
different flavours of these PCI devices.

820
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,610
two switches management switch for
external access one data plane switch for

821
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,150
accessing the actual topology that
you create As an experimenter,

822
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,930
just some of the examples
of the use cases that that

823
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,460
might be useful particularly
to this community, right?

824
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:50,290
So with NDN wanting to do storage and
processing of data in the network.

825
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,970
This is kind of part and
parcel here of the architecture for

826
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:59,220
fabric You can do sort of direct
pass through just the switch.

827
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,240
If you just want to bypass the site,
you can pop the traffic into the site and

828
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,900
do some processing within the site
storage or processing on the fly.

829
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:15,080
You can host the entire application and
again have avid serve.

830
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,910
Packet flows coming in
from multiple points.

831
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,870
So line rate stateful.

832
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,920
And again, we don't know dictate what
the state represents so within this case.

833
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,130
It could be the data caches,
it could be some control plane state,

834
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,120
some combination of the two.

835
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,889
That's up to the experimenter to decide.

836
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,460
We're also paying a lot of attention
to measurement capabilities.

837
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:43,210
So, each site likely was going to have
a just GPS discipline clock for PTP.

838
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,890
But so that you can take kind of

839
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:51,390
Packet Tracer spec of snapshots across
the network with millisecond accuracy.

840
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,860
And have some idea of what's
going through the network.

841
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,150
Now obviously, it's very high packet
rates like hundred gigabits per second,

842
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,240
you won't be able to hold
a whole lot of traffic in these.

843
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,200
But nonetheless, it's a possibility
that it opens up to do this.

844
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,110
We will have smart videos as well as
the server's themselves instrumented for

845
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,563
measuring power consumption.

846
00:56:13,563 --> 00:56:17,638
Some optical layer measurements were
available, now this facility will not have

847
00:56:17,638 --> 00:56:20,880
an edge optical layer,
that's not part of the architecture.

848
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,292
However, some level of measurements from
the optical layer should be available.

849
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:30,087
And of course, the traditional
utilization measures from CPU, memory,

850
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,154
disk etc, for their accounts.

851
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,266
Port mirroring will be supported as well,
so

852
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,500
that you can capture
certain flows if you want.

853
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,626
And I think that's it.

854
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:43,581
I wanted to keep it short and
perhaps leave a little bit of room for

855
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:44,906
questions instead.

856
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:49,740
I'm gonna stop sharing maybe for
now and wait for questions.

857
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:55,501
There's a question of how users
conduct experiments, can you hear me?

858
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:57,060
Can you hear me okay?

859
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,560
>> Yes, we heard you.

860
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,810
>> Yeah, so, the users define
the topology of what they want to do,

861
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,870
they define the properties
of that topology,

862
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,390
they define the elements of
the topology in the configuration.

863
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,820
Essentially, it's either going
through the portal or using the API's.

864
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,865
The user interface is going to,

865
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:20,274
a primary user interface is likely
to be through Jupiter notebooks.

866
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:24,976
So that you have a programmable kind
of scriptable environment where you can

867
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:28,579
launch your experiments,
configure it, collect data,

868
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:33,150
process data and then hopefully get
the results you're looking for the.

869
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,073
So this gonna rely on federated identity.

870
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:40,214
So the researchers from the US
institutions are part of in common

871
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:43,601
federation should have no
trouble accessing this.

872
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:49,617
By the time we're done with the
construction, we will have an AUP, as well

873
00:57:49,617 --> 00:57:56,133
as other policies to help understand how
best to use facility in the near future.

874
00:57:56,133 --> 00:58:00,174
And we're planning to open up a facility
to early experimenters in the summer of

875
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:00,790
2021.

876
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:06,197
It's going to be more of a kind
of a first come first serve.

877
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:10,017
We will be working with some members of
the research community to kinda help us

878
00:58:10,017 --> 00:58:12,131
come in and
kick the tires on the facility,

879
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:15,274
figure out what works,
what doesn't, what can work better.

880
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:22,653
So the answer is no,
this is a construction project,

881
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:27,261
we've only completed the first
year as I just mentioned,

882
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:34,139
the general availability is 2023,
limited availability is next year 2021.

883
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,469
So how we can calculate
participate in the fabric?

884
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:40,814
So the first thing I would encourage
you to do is to visit our website.

885
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:43,518
What is fabric.net?

886
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:48,933
What is fabric.net, there is a button
there, you can click get involved and

887
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:54,120
you will get monthly or periodic
anyways mailers as to what's going on.

888
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,183
We are hosting a number of workshops
with different members of different

889
00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:02,646
communities, trying to collect more
requirements, ideas for experiments,

890
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:05,594
tools that could be useful
to other experimenters.

891
00:59:05,594 --> 00:59:10,407
One of the things that we have in mind
is being able to stand up kind of an on

892
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:14,283
demand NDN profile experiment
within fabric such that.

893
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:19,028
People who want to use NDN kind of out of
the box can just kind of press the button

894
00:59:19,028 --> 00:59:23,420
and launch in NDN network of the size
that they want across the country.

895
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:28,752
So that idea of an experiment profile
is pretty integral to our thinking.

896
00:59:40,488 --> 00:59:45,758
Yes, the idea of fabric is that
you have dedicated resources.

897
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:49,435
The question was, would the experimenters
have dedicated resources if necessary?

898
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:52,575
Yes, the whole idea is that you reserve
the resources that you need, and

899
00:59:52,575 --> 00:59:56,070
we either tell you sorry we're not
available help you with a calendar.

900
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,128
Schedule your experiment in the future or

901
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,082
provide your resources right
away if they're available.

902
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:09,068
But reproducibility which,
reproducibility is the driver here,

903
01:00:09,068 --> 01:00:15,232
but in order to get the reproducibility,
you have to have dedicated resources.

904
01:00:15,232 --> 01:00:16,564
Usually reserved for your use.

905
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:25,435
Fabric will also offer a shared
layer three capacity for

906
01:00:25,435 --> 01:00:30,231
those types of experiments
where perhaps current IP

907
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:34,922
implementation is enough
to move the data around.

908
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,691
But the experimenter
might be just interested

909
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:41,668
in experimenting with higher level
concepts and applications and

910
01:00:41,668 --> 01:00:46,579
they don't really want to rule the whole
entire architecture or protocol stack.

911
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:51,346
Or they just wanna experiment with
applications, but in addition to that,

912
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:55,143
to that layer three default kind
of best effort layer three,

913
01:00:55,143 --> 01:01:00,670
there will be dedicated capacity that will
be reservable across the entire footprint.

914
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:09,070
We also have an extension now,
plans extension to Europe and Japan.

915
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:12,473
So United Kingdom, Bristol,

916
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:17,837
the Netherlands Interserve Amsterdam,
Switzerland CERN,

917
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:22,490
Interserve Tokyo,
we will have sites there as well.

918
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:31,380
>> Okay, I guess we're getting ready for
the IoT and edge applications panel.

919
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,600
Maybe all the panelists
can start to get ready.

920
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,460
And I wanted to kind of
start out just saying,

921
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,320
what distinguishes edge applications.

922
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,360
And it's nice that we had
this earlier session where

923
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,210
we had people speaking about
different edge applications.

924
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,645
And we had that morning session,
which was sort of the opposite and

925
01:01:56,645 --> 01:02:01,595
those applications made heavy
use of caching and storage and

926
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:04,880
movement of persistent data.

927
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,944
And I think that in contrast
to Ed's application is kind

928
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:14,685
of focus on using NDN as
a communication protocol and

929
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:20,632
the data could be more affirmable
although still maybe durable.

930
01:02:20,632 --> 01:02:26,474
And it makes really heavy use of security
so that in the automotive applications and

931
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:31,110
really exploit that broadcast
nature of the edge networks.

932
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:36,790
And that was something that
Jeff mentioned in his talk.

933
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,810
And I think it was particularly
interesting how the Intel

934
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,340
person kind of set this up for us.

935
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:50,060
And I think that NDN as
a NSF project really did get

936
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,780
started not looking at the edge because
it was a future internet application.

937
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,290
But it's interesting to note
that the roots of this and

938
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:01,740
the new way to look at networking and
some of the early work at

939
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,310
PARC really was focused on things
you could do with the edge.

940
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:09,400
And when you do that, you don't have
to worry so much about IP routing and

941
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,220
other elements of the infrastructure
that we already have, and

942
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:20,070
you can solve that problem at the edge
with NDN style communications.

943
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,720
So what we're gonna do here
is I'm going to have these

944
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,830
four excellent panelists speak too.

945
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:29,705
We'll do it in the order
of Justin Caswell,

946
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:34,013
then Dan Massey, then and then Dang Hu.

947
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:38,330
And I wanna start with Justin.

948
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:45,101
And what, I wanted to introduce Justin,

949
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:50,909
but I lost that, my introduction.

950
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:55,512
I hope they get it.

951
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:01,610
Okay, I do not have it anymore.

952
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,548
Okay, well hang on a second.

953
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:08,334
[LAUGH] All right, so
Justin is the founder and CEO of Rakhine,

954
01:04:08,334 --> 01:04:13,583
which is a company that focuses on
blockchain network solutions for

955
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,580
the telecommunications industry.

956
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:22,577
He's had 20 plus years and communication
systems with a focus on wireless for

957
01:04:22,577 --> 01:04:25,184
both terrestrial and satellite.

958
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:30,240
And that includes companies
like ExxonMobil and FedEx.

959
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,290
Justin is a serial entrepreneur, a full
stack developer and an innovative leader.

960
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:39,150
He works directly with network operators,
data centers, governments and

961
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:43,510
private industry in cutting
edge technology operations.

962
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:47,609
His work has a specific
focus within 5G networks,

963
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:53,346
advanced communication systems,
leveraging AI and of course, NDN.

964
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:56,984
So, Justin, do you wanna go ahead and

965
01:04:56,984 --> 01:05:01,418
explain to us some of
the issues that you see and

966
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:06,500
things that will be
interesting to the audience?

967
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,440
Thanks.

968
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,161
>> Thanks, Kathy for
the introduction, yeah, so

969
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:15,079
some of the things we're working on.

970
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:19,660
So just right out of the gate, I think
what our involvement was with NDN is we

971
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,469
wanted to use a blockchain
application running on top of NDN.

972
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:28,184
Because there's [LAUGH] a lot
of efficiencies you can you can

973
01:05:28,184 --> 01:05:29,982
glean from just that.

974
01:05:29,982 --> 01:05:35,356
But then we we moved into a little bit
more of the core network operations and

975
01:05:35,356 --> 01:05:41,496
we started looking at saying, okay, well,
how can we apply NDN in a 5G deployment or

976
01:05:41,496 --> 01:05:45,619
any kind of modern wireless
network deployment really?

977
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:48,961
So we kind of started dialing
in on the IoT aspects,

978
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:55,490
the challenges wrapped around encryption,
bringing that in through your gateway.

979
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,596
Lots of proprietary gateways and

980
01:05:57,596 --> 01:06:02,416
hardware out there that you have to
overcome, so a lot of challenges there.

981
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:07,098
I think if we can work a little bit
more with OEMs and get NDN integrated

982
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:13,110
directly into devices, I think that
would be a substantial step forward.

983
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:16,510
In addition to that,
I think if we could get NDN,

984
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:20,050
working directly in the gateways for
those devices.

985
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,300
That's another substantial challenge,

986
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,910
that I think that would
bring a lot to the industry.

987
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,360
Some of the other things that we started
looking at moving away from just IoT, but

988
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,510
really looking at broad compute platforms,
right?

989
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:39,316
So how do you take all of these things at
the edge, whether that's IoT devices or

990
01:06:39,316 --> 01:06:43,361
you're taking autonomous vehicles,
or UAV's or Smart Cities.

991
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:47,071
So there's a ton of data that
you need to ingest, especially,

992
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:49,950
whenever you start looking
at 5G deployments.

993
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:54,625
So whenever you say, all right,
we've got all these devices.

994
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:57,998
We've got all these users
just machine to machine,

995
01:06:57,998 --> 01:07:00,229
some of its actual users to users.

996
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:03,939
And you've got all these different
dynamic sets of information that you're

997
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:04,572
pulling in.

998
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:08,560
Now, you're not only having to deal with
the baseband processing of that, right?

999
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,117
But now,

1000
01:07:09,117 --> 01:07:13,785
you have to take these these applications
that are running on that 5G network.

1001
01:07:13,785 --> 01:07:18,627
And then now, you have to say, okay, well,
how are we gonna get it pushed through and

1002
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:23,020
actually meet the requirements of the low
latency that 5G kind of requires?

1003
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:27,536
So looking at that,
we were working on an edge based solution.

1004
01:07:27,536 --> 01:07:31,671
It's a mobile edge compute platform
that integrates NDN in the middle of

1005
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:33,180
the technology stack.

1006
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:40,570
So we're using Mellanox NIC's programmable
NIC's kind of under the network side.

1007
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,637
So we're just layering that in, and

1008
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:47,517
then we're using sub-frameworks to build
out some intelligent routing platforms.

1009
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:51,876
And we're just leveraging some AI and some
other existing frameworks that are out

1010
01:07:51,876 --> 01:07:55,172
there currently, but
we're going to be expanding on those.

1011
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:59,230
And so what we'll actually do is
combine the baseband processing.

1012
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,214
We put NDN in the middle, right, and

1013
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:04,490
then we can push the the next
the Mellanox NIC's down below.

1014
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:09,438
And what that's allowing us to do
theoretically, we haven't proven this yet,

1015
01:08:09,438 --> 01:08:14,094
but what we're hoping to prove right,
is that now we can intelligently move

1016
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:17,689
data across the RAND, or
from edge or local data centers.

1017
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:20,614
Back out to these edge
compute platforms and so

1018
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:24,144
we're looking at an efficiency level for
for routing.

1019
01:08:24,144 --> 01:08:28,826
But what we're also really considering
here is having a data aware

1020
01:08:28,826 --> 01:08:34,880
platform where now, you can deploy
these these edge based applications.

1021
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,500
Would typically normally run
at like a public cloud level.

1022
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:43,143
And so now, if you can push that out onto
this mobile edge compute platform that can

1023
01:08:43,143 --> 01:08:45,518
then be tied into a 5G wireless network.

1024
01:08:45,518 --> 01:08:48,946
It doesn't have to be a 5G
wireless network, but obviously,

1025
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:51,872
you get a lot of benefits if
you if it's tied in there.

1026
01:08:51,872 --> 01:08:55,278
And so the idea right is that now
you can have operators running their

1027
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:57,389
applications on this compute platform.

1028
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:01,996
You can have developers running
application on this compute platform.

1029
01:09:01,996 --> 01:09:06,318
But you're also really getting a lot
of network efficiencies on both

1030
01:09:06,318 --> 01:09:09,679
the RAND side, and
then your hardline network side.

1031
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,678
And so those are kind of the main
things that we're looking at,

1032
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:14,610
we've got a lot of interest on on those.

1033
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:19,513
We're doing some test beds here in
the United States, down in Texas, and

1034
01:09:19,513 --> 01:09:22,282
then also in a couple of other countries,

1035
01:09:22,282 --> 01:09:25,941
where they're interested
in this type of a solution.

1036
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:30,750
That being said, we're also launching some
of our own applications on that mobile

1037
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,200
edge compute platform.

1038
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,900
And so that's tying it to more
of like a gaming use case,

1039
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,578
just working with kind of NVIDIA and
some others in that room.

1040
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,320
So we've got some pretty
substantial challenges on our side.

1041
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,148
Everything is pretty new right now, we're
still figuring out a lot of the the 5G

1042
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:51,286
infrastructure build out and deployments.

1043
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:53,743
Especially, whenever you look,

1044
01:09:53,743 --> 01:09:57,906
just at the global kind of 5G
evolution that's going on.

1045
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:03,280
But we believe that where the real
unlocking potential is at the edge.

1046
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:09,286
We feel the networks will come up to par,
right,

1047
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:14,318
through the evolution of
5G on the wireless side.

1048
01:10:14,318 --> 01:10:15,803
And then the data centers,

1049
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:19,743
and the networks themselves there,
we also feel are gonna be upgraded as

1050
01:10:19,743 --> 01:10:22,984
well over the coming years to
meet those demands of the 5G.

1051
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:27,807
And so sitting at the edge with
a mobile edge compute platform that

1052
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,920
delivers NDN out of the box.

1053
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,413
Is our goal and
I think that's our first step and

1054
01:10:33,413 --> 01:10:38,579
really trying to commercialize NDN
at least from our optics, right?

1055
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:44,095
And then applying the the NDN blockchain
application solution on top of that

1056
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:49,626
to bring in some more automation if you
will, so we can validate data flows.

1057
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:53,636
Now, you can validate analytics, immutable
records for audits, and tracing and

1058
01:10:53,636 --> 01:10:55,189
all kinds of different things.

1059
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:59,889
So that's really where we sit,
we've got a lot of challenges like I said,

1060
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:00,718
ahead of us.

1061
01:11:00,718 --> 01:11:06,942
But we're getting more and more interest
from industry, both in the telecom side.

1062
01:11:06,942 --> 01:11:12,037
But then also private industry for
hardware and software applications.

1063
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,847
>> Okay, thanks, Justin,
let's go through everybody, and

1064
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:24,930
then we'll take some questions at the end
or you can even question each other.

1065
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:30,153
So next up is Dan Massey and
Dan is the program lead to

1066
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:36,966
the operate through portion of
the DODs 5G to next G initiatives.

1067
01:11:36,966 --> 01:11:41,956
He was previously a faculty
member at Colorado Boulder and

1068
01:11:41,956 --> 01:11:46,344
program manager for
the Cyber Security Division Science and

1069
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,628
Technology directorate, that's the CST.

1070
01:11:49,628 --> 01:11:54,629
Yeah, and in the Department of Homeland
Security as a CSP program manager,

1071
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:59,634
he developed and manage programs where
researchers from both academics and

1072
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:04,482
industry, identify, address and
deploy cyber security solutions that

1073
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:08,740
improves the security and
resilience of the Internet.

1074
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:13,690
And Dan was one of the original
NSF FIA NDN project.

1075
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,290
Okay, Dan.

1076
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,070
Great.
Well, thank you.

1077
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,930
I really appreciate
the opportunity to be here.

1078
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:24,170
And I've got some, I think interesting,
new stuff to talk about.

1079
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:26,510
So as Kathy was just pointing out,

1080
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:31,780
I've just come on board in the DODs,
5G, the next G initiative.

1081
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,534
And so I'm the program manager for
something called can operate through.

1082
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:40,310
And I wanted to kind of say a little bit
about what that is and, why I think that's

1083
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:44,826
particularly relevant to NDN and
why we should be talking about that here?

1084
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:49,627
So as you guys already know,
right, as already mentioned in

1085
01:12:49,627 --> 01:12:55,160
Justin stock just a little bit
is 5G is coming up pretty quick.

1086
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,920
It's giving us a lot of new opportunities.

1087
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:04,489
And so from the DOD side, we're very
interested in how we can leverage that,

1088
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:10,775
and how we can do that without thinking
in terms of the traditional model.

1089
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:15,970
Which I'll claim devolved from
the good old Paul Baran multipaths

1090
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:20,882
many ways to get there to what,
but now is often more of a circuit

1091
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:25,990
based connection and
all too often we've relied on that.

1092
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:31,090
As this community knows well the securing
the channel rather than securing the data.

1093
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:35,559
That all goes away if we do it with 5G.

1094
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:40,263
So in our vision of 5G in
the operate through vision of 5G,

1095
01:13:40,263 --> 01:13:42,991
we're gonna say we have to come and

1096
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:48,845
we have to operate through existing
5G networks that we don't operate.

1097
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:52,166
We don't trust, but
we need to get sensitive,

1098
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:57,530
possibly even classified
information across those networks.

1099
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,780
In an environment where I don't
know what the network is,

1100
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,180
I don't have the network equipment.

1101
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:10,050
The network equipment is manufactured
by who knows who's operating it.

1102
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:14,080
And so can we operate
through that kind of network?

1103
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,940
That's the SD idea and

1104
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:20,020
it fits here I think into the edge piece
because a lot of this communication

1105
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,820
in the 5G world especially, there's
a lot of interesting stuff on the edge.

1106
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,610
Once I get that inside a secure DOD
network, that's a different matter.

1107
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:32,030
But I've got all these
things on the 5G network.

1108
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:35,760
At the edge that are gonna need to
communicate, they can be vehicles,

1109
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,120
this was discussed earlier.

1110
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,110
Earlier today there's a lot
of interesting stuff for

1111
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:43,610
those vehicles are gonna
be on on 5G networks.

1112
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:46,080
So how does that communication work?

1113
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,610
And how do you do that securely
in a zero trust environment?

1114
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,754
And I'm gonna, and I think this group
might have some answers to that.

1115
01:14:55,754 --> 01:15:00,552
So when we say zero trust, I wanna make
a slight shift from the really good stuff,

1116
01:15:00,552 --> 01:15:02,893
thank you to NIST for hosting all this.

1117
01:15:02,893 --> 01:15:07,470
And NIST has some great documents
out there on zero trust.

1118
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:11,060
We wanna take a slightly different
spin on zero trust in that

1119
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:16,030
often zero trust is focused on,
I operate the network but

1120
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:20,110
I don't necessarily I don't want
to build a wall around my network.

1121
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,780
In our case,
I wanna take zero trust a step further and

1122
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,710
so may even say this is already
covered in the NIST documents and

1123
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:31,590
it maybe in this case,
I don't even operate the network.

1124
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,340
I'm just a user on the network.

1125
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:41,230
There's all these different paths, all
these different knobs I can tune with 5G.

1126
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:48,160
And how do I do that, and
somebody posted into, Dave ran posted in,

1127
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,230
do we care about traffic
analysis absolutely, right.

1128
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:56,340
In fact, I think that's one of our
biggest interesting challenges.

1129
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:00,620
And so one thing that we've
talked about a lot is, so,

1130
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:05,620
when I talk about securely operating
across an untrusted 5G network.

1131
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,612
I'm gonna assume the data is encrypted.

1132
01:16:07,612 --> 01:16:10,330
I'm gonna assume that someone
can exfiltrate the data but,

1133
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,360
they can't break the encryption.

1134
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:17,496
So I'm not too worried about,
me sending a confidential

1135
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:23,060
message to Justin encrypted
with a appropriate cryptography

1136
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:28,203
that we both share, so
who is gonna to get access to that?

1137
01:16:28,203 --> 01:16:29,617
But he's not gonna be able to decrypt it.

1138
01:16:29,617 --> 01:16:33,162
>> [LAUGH] I'm the bad guy.

1139
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:34,015
>> Yeah.

1140
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:36,645
We could set defense,
we can kind of pick it up.

1141
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:44,555
But what I am worried about
is that traffic analysis.

1142
01:16:44,555 --> 01:16:48,891
The analogy we've been using is the pizza
deliveries to the pentagon, right?

1143
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:54,180
So, the thought there is by sitting out at
the pentagon sitting parking lot across

1144
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:59,018
the street from the pentagon and
just counting food deliveries in and out.

1145
01:16:59,018 --> 01:17:03,192
You may be able to infer quite a bit
about operational tempo, right.

1146
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:06,878
Friday night, a number of pizzas
show up that could be Bob or

1147
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:08,900
Alice's retirement party.

1148
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,640
That could be that means,
people are working late and

1149
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,160
there's some kind of hop going on.

1150
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,230
So we're worried about
that in this scenario,

1151
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:20,210
which is can I operate through this
network without revealing too much

1152
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,690
and maybe there's a bunch of
ways I could do that, but.

1153
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:30,805
But certainly traffic analysis
volume metrics are of interest.

1154
01:17:30,805 --> 01:17:36,810
And we want to see how that can work.

1155
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,781
But even more so
than on the confidentiality piece,

1156
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:43,167
the availability piece is really
the exciting part for us.

1157
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:48,213
And so with all these different paths,
how can I make this work, right.

1158
01:17:48,213 --> 01:17:52,583
We can do dynamic spectrum allocations,
right.

1159
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:57,312
So unlike our traditional wireless where
we're on channel five or channel seven or

1160
01:17:57,312 --> 01:18:01,159
whatever, we can hop around 5G
gives us the ability to hop around,

1161
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:03,680
it gives us all these other possibilities.

1162
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,340
It gives us the opportunity to relay but

1163
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:10,240
I'll tell you that's really hard
to do with a circuit, right.

1164
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,080
There may be some other approach.

1165
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,080
I don't know, maybe there's
some other type of networking.

1166
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,080
I think, yeah.

1167
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,500
Could be about names or data or
something instead of, but so

1168
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,740
I think there could be some
interesting things there.

1169
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,310
So that's just sort of
the big picture challenge.

1170
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:32,160
I wanted to,
I wanted to paint is just to say, what

1171
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:37,520
about 5G and what about specifically,
availability and 5G and

1172
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,510
if I can get additional confidentiality
and integrity in 5G, that's a bonus.

1173
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:46,670
But, but I think there's some
interesting ways to look at that.

1174
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,250
And you'll see last thing and
then I'll pass it on to the next panel.

1175
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:53,370
So you'll see three things
coming out of this program.

1176
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,600
It's a brand new program.

1177
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,790
So we've just added Professor Roy
from the University of Washington,

1178
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,130
who's a 5G expert.

1179
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,962
So he's running something
called Beyond 5G.

1180
01:19:06,962 --> 01:19:10,026
What do we do after 5G?

1181
01:19:10,026 --> 01:19:12,060
Cuz 5G won't be the end.

1182
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,200
I'm running the operate through portion,
which is to say, hey,

1183
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,770
how do I operate on that
existing 5G network?

1184
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:22,500
And there's a group that's currently
out there called accelerate,

1185
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,700
which is helping get this
adoption into government systems.

1186
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,730
All three of which, I think could
potentially be interesting to NDN.

1187
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:35,570
So I just wanted to kind of put
that out there to the group and,

1188
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,390
of course the answer any questions.

1189
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:38,909
That's it.
I think that's it for me.

1190
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:40,280
>> Okay.
>> Kathy, I will pass it on the next.

1191
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:41,990
>> Okay, great.

1192
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,750
Thank you, Dan.

1193
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,110
We'll get back to probably
with some questions.

1194
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:50,344
Next I'd like to introduce Sokwoo Rhee and
he's an entrepreneur and

1195
01:19:50,344 --> 01:19:54,651
executive with expertise in the internet
of things, smart cities and

1196
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:59,469
wireless networks for commercial,
industrial and military applications.

1197
01:19:59,469 --> 01:20:02,229
He's one of the pioneers
who have initiated and

1198
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:05,474
grown the IoT industry
since the early 2,000's.

1199
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:10,388
He is currently Associate Director for
the cyber physical systems innovation

1200
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:15,035
at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology are hosting this.

1201
01:20:15,035 --> 01:20:17,685
And he's been covering enough.

1202
01:20:17,685 --> 01:20:20,860
Station programs for IoT and Smart Cities.

1203
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:26,050
He manages the global city teams
challenge, a US federal government

1204
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:31,910
program to develop a global ecosystem of
major business and technology stakeholders

1205
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:37,340
to create replicable and
scalable IoT Smart City projects.

1206
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,012
Prior to joining US government,
he was co-founder and

1207
01:20:41,012 --> 01:20:43,050
CTO of Millennial dot Net Inc.

1208
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:46,252
One of the first to
successfully commercialize low

1209
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:50,680
power wireless sensor networks and
IoT technologies from Academia.

1210
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:56,083
His work and achievements have been
recognized in multiple boards including

1211
01:20:56,083 --> 01:21:00,917
MIT technology reviews top innovators
under 35 and he went to MIT.

1212
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:06,840
And I would like to give him
a chance to speak now, thank you.

1213
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,220
>> Thank you, Kathy, by the way,

1214
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:13,900
I didn't expect you to read through my
whole bio, that wasn't really intention.

1215
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,010
And also, I am now much older than 35,
that was a long time ago.

1216
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,498
So don't get me wrong for
anyone, I don't look like 35.

1217
01:21:23,498 --> 01:21:28,424
So I didn't even have to say it,
so thank you for the intro.

1218
01:21:28,424 --> 01:21:34,732
So I work on Smart City,
I work on large scale IoT in general,

1219
01:21:34,732 --> 01:21:39,459
but currently Smart Cities
is my focus area.

1220
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:46,941
Now, I'd like to provide a little bit
of perspectives on how sparsity and

1221
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:52,858
new networking technologies
including edge computing,

1222
01:21:52,858 --> 01:21:56,375
can work together or may not work.

1223
01:21:56,375 --> 01:22:00,304
So there are a lot of buzz about
edge computing these days.

1224
01:22:00,304 --> 01:22:02,775
And then even in the Smart City area,

1225
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:08,100
a lot of people are talking about
how to use edge computing concepts.

1226
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,700
In the context of a Smart City and
in many cases,

1227
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:17,570
that what I see is technologies
like me for companies.

1228
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:21,219
Basically, bringing this new concept and

1229
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:26,688
try to push to the cities and
the city officials, in many cases,

1230
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,789
municipalities are perplex any cases,
always gonna help me, right?

1231
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:38,051
So there's a huge gap between this the
actual users, it was Smart City or the,

1232
01:22:38,051 --> 01:22:43,345
for lack of a better word, customers
that was Smart City technologies.

1233
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:47,610
And the suppliers, and
that question is done new here,

1234
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:50,260
it's been around for a long time.

1235
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:55,335
But when it comes to new emerging
technologies such as 5G or

1236
01:22:55,335 --> 01:23:00,320
edge computing,
that problem is amplified much bigger.

1237
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,290
Because edge computing conceptually,
the way that typically,

1238
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,729
the companies explain that is,

1239
01:23:07,729 --> 01:23:12,537
use that computing you can reduce
the bandwidth requirement.

1240
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:16,722
And the companies make it a big deal,
and then say, so

1241
01:23:16,722 --> 01:23:21,651
you have to install edge computing
capabilities in a city, and

1242
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:27,055
then city officials go, okay,
why should I worry about it?

1243
01:23:27,055 --> 01:23:30,833
Only reason I should worry about
is because I got to pay more for

1244
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:33,435
the cell network, cell bandwidth.

1245
01:23:33,435 --> 01:23:39,820
That's really, then question comes down
to, okay, if I install this devices,

1246
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:45,980
are you saying that I don't need to use
cell network to get to the edge compute?

1247
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,668
So the last mile problem
is still not solved,

1248
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:51,571
because you cannot use
WiFi because there's too

1249
01:23:51,571 --> 01:23:55,550
short in city environment in a whole
environment, it may be okay.

1250
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:59,904
But it gets down to broad
Metropolitan environment,

1251
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:04,549
you still cannot really avoid
relying on a cell network,

1252
01:24:04,549 --> 01:24:07,756
even if your edge devices are built in.

1253
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:12,648
So the point I'm making is this,
in Smart City area,

1254
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:16,760
edge computing is a 5G's buzzwords.

1255
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,799
I think there is still time and
there is a gap in adoption,

1256
01:24:20,799 --> 01:24:23,420
especially, it's computing 5G.

1257
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:28,483
I think is gonna happen much quicker,
because Apple no matter what, and

1258
01:24:28,483 --> 01:24:33,309
frankly speaking, the carriers will
not want to let us not have 5G.

1259
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:37,530
They wanna simply just keep manufacturing
devices on 5G, replace it with

1260
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,560
the 4G device and we weren't enough,
I have a lot of choice out there.

1261
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,371
But when you come into the municipal
network or municipalities,

1262
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:49,607
who are probably the bigger customer,
that's a little bit different.

1263
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:54,587
Because they may still, although, networks
are still operating in 2G network.

1264
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:57,938
A lot of people, many people,
not many people know why, but

1265
01:24:57,938 --> 01:25:01,177
a lot of them are still running on 2G or
even 3G networks.

1266
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:05,101
So point as for
edge computing and NDN too,

1267
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:10,552
these kinda new concepts to
wanna get into the mainstream.

1268
01:25:10,552 --> 01:25:14,476
I think we need to have
a very clear pitch, and

1269
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:17,692
very clear and convincing message.

1270
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:22,698
Why this new technologies we're gonna
help municipalities to operate and

1271
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:26,364
deliver their services,
and fulfill their mission.

1272
01:25:26,364 --> 01:25:28,626
I'm gonna stop there for now.

1273
01:25:30,716 --> 01:25:35,590
>> Okay, thank you, and thanks for
introducing this idea that maybe

1274
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:40,378
we need to think about creating
applications which have some pull

1275
01:25:40,378 --> 01:25:45,270
instead of trying to push them on
people who might not want them.

1276
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,969
So maybe we're looking
in the wrong places, so-

1277
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:48,890
>> Wow, you summarized it, I spent 10

1278
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:54,570
minutes talking a lot, you summarized
it in [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE], awesome.

1279
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:57,218
>> No, no, you are very good, thank you.

1280
01:25:57,218 --> 01:26:01,746
Next, I'd like to introduce Dr.
Geng Wu and he's an Intel fellow and

1281
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:05,990
a Chief Technologist for
wireless technologies and standards.

1282
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:12,360
He leads Intel's 5G and 6G technology
development and ecosystem collaboration.

1283
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,709
Okay, that's what comes after 5G, I guess,

1284
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:19,578
he serves as the head of
Intel's delegation to 3GPP.

1285
01:26:19,578 --> 01:26:24,654
And he's a director of the board
of the IOWN Global Forum,

1286
01:26:24,654 --> 01:26:31,820
the multi-fire alliance and
the automotive edge computing consortium.

1287
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,276
So, boy, you've got your fingers and

1288
01:26:35,276 --> 01:26:39,475
everything at the edge,
go ahead, your turn.

1289
01:26:39,475 --> 01:26:45,100
>> Thank you very much, so
it is my great honor to be here and

1290
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:49,172
well, if there's no virus situation,

1291
01:26:49,172 --> 01:26:56,146
we would be having a drink with
the co-panelists after the session.

1292
01:26:56,146 --> 01:27:00,818
Excited to be here, so let's me just

1293
01:27:00,818 --> 01:27:05,356
say a few words about why I'm here.

1294
01:27:05,356 --> 01:27:12,273
So the topic that this particular
session is addressing,

1295
01:27:12,273 --> 01:27:16,517
it's actually very interesting.

1296
01:27:16,517 --> 01:27:20,704
Internet of Things and edge,

1297
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:27,915
both are very much to
the heart of the 5G industry.

1298
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:34,313
And also the next upgrade platform
upgrade that in the next ten years,

1299
01:27:34,313 --> 01:27:38,982
we're working certainly
on the next generation.

1300
01:27:38,982 --> 01:27:44,949
So there's some fundamental
technology drivers supposes,

1301
01:27:44,949 --> 01:27:49,767
for example, the need for
network performance,

1302
01:27:49,767 --> 01:27:55,160
as well as the localization
of machine intelligence and

1303
01:27:55,160 --> 01:28:00,553
machine learning are really
driving the networking and

1304
01:28:00,553 --> 01:28:04,820
computing functions for the network edge.

1305
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:11,160
Having said so, there is also assumption,

1306
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,940
kind of in common between
these two important,

1307
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:20,770
probably the most important aspect
of the technology development for

1308
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:25,280
this and the next generation,
which is that

1309
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,230
The solutions are well we do see,

1310
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:35,300
in both cases we have
the fragmented the design and

1311
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:41,935
the solutions and so basically
basically different optimizations.

1312
01:28:41,935 --> 01:28:47,285
And quite often we see the issues that

1313
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:51,305
yes, these solutions are hard to scale and

1314
01:28:51,305 --> 01:28:57,750
some of the panelists the colleagues
here already mentioned that.

1315
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:04,590
So basically, how do we actually
horizontalise the technology and

1316
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:09,277
more importantly the market
at the industry?

1317
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:14,750
That's probably one of the key
issues that we need to address.

1318
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:21,030
If you look deeper from
a purely technology viewpoint,

1319
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:27,580
I think most of the issues really
come in from the fact that we

1320
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:34,250
are dealing with a evolve
the computing and

1321
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:39,550
networking and data model.

1322
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:44,510
So that's a particular model actually,
that drives the way we design the network,

1323
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,270
we did our platform.

1324
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:49,280
We did our applications as
part of actually evolving.

1325
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:56,070
To be more specific, for
example, we do expect

1326
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,940
the next generation system to be
platform to be at least order for

1327
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:06,290
magnitude faster than what we have today.

1328
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:15,300
We are seeing that the network,

1329
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:21,370
the switching fabric for example,
increasingly programmable even today,

1330
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:25,330
we can easily do one single part.

1331
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:31,970
This terabit is for multi terabits per
second, fully programmable switching.

1332
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:33,450
So that's not an issue.

1333
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:40,160
So there's it, that's a tremendous
the technology opportunities there.

1334
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,830
We also see the challenges.

1335
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:47,729
We need to have a deeper understanding of

1336
01:30:47,729 --> 01:30:51,620
the computer communication and

1337
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:55,940
the data model, what that means and

1338
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:03,017
how the NDN play a critical
enabling role in this new word?

1339
01:31:03,017 --> 01:31:07,773
Network obviously is no longer
just a communication pipe that

1340
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:09,606
connects the two ends.

1341
01:31:09,606 --> 01:31:15,666
Is so tremendous your networking,
computing and data processing.

1342
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:20,433
So those things are actually
the cool thing is that NDN was

1343
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:25,714
actually very much designed from
the very beginning to serve.

1344
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:29,820
To actually assume that
the network is suggesting not just

1345
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:34,450
a collection of communication pipes,
so that's important.

1346
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:40,009
I think Dan touched on
the fact that the zero

1347
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:46,039
trust was because of
the way NDN was designed.

1348
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:49,542
That there are some unique capabilities,

1349
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:55,379
that security capabilities that
enable us to do something different,

1350
01:31:55,379 --> 01:31:59,660
and those are the areas that
we are looking forward to

1351
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:04,038
work with the research community and
to to address and

1352
01:32:04,038 --> 01:32:09,000
that's the reason why we are very
much a strong supporter and

1353
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,820
passionate about the technology.

1354
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,000
Back to you, Nicole.

1355
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:23,900
>> Okay, what I guess I should there's
one question I have here this very

1356
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,790
specifically for Justin and let's do that
and we'll see if any others come up and

1357
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:32,570
see what we can talk about
what among ourselves.

1358
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:38,004
If we'd like to know how far along is
the NDN plus block chain solution and

1359
01:32:38,004 --> 01:32:43,990
what aspects are furthest along
development, prototype,s deployed, etc?

1360
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:50,400
>> Yeah, so we finished we finished
the minimum viable product and

1361
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,550
kind of proof of concept early last year.

1362
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:59,550
So we've been continuing to develop that
product, though, so that the original

1363
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:05,110
genesis block was created over a year ago,
almost a year and a half ago now.

1364
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:10,777
And so now we're at the stage where we're
actually deploying that in test beds,

1365
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:14,539
like I said, so we're gonna be
taking part of that application and

1366
01:33:14,539 --> 01:33:17,453
deploying it in our mobile
edge compute platform.

1367
01:33:17,453 --> 01:33:21,718
And then we also have a separate
standalone application that's primarily

1368
01:33:21,718 --> 01:33:25,330
just gonna be used for
localized payment processing.

1369
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:28,250
And so, we're doing that.

1370
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:32,607
So where you can actually take and just
install this on like a Raspberry Pi or

1371
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:33,790
whatever, right?

1372
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:37,274
And then but the idea right is that you
have everything localized your web server,

1373
01:33:37,274 --> 01:33:39,810
your APIs, everything's localized right?

1374
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:44,319
And eventually where we wanna get to
with this is we wanna have the entire

1375
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,336
front end application built with NDN,
right?

1376
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:48,357
Built on top of NDN.

1377
01:33:48,357 --> 01:33:50,960
And so right now we're just using
it as kind of like a middleware.

1378
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,704
And we're just passing it through
the satellite network and

1379
01:33:53,704 --> 01:33:56,197
or any other network that
we're kinda using, right?

1380
01:33:56,197 --> 01:34:01,173
But we're trying to prove out that we
can use NDN across a satellite link here

1381
01:34:01,173 --> 01:34:05,410
in the next couple of weeks with
our block-chain application.

1382
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:10,105
And then I think the next steps for
that right is that to kinda go

1383
01:34:10,105 --> 01:34:14,271
back to kinda some of the things
Dan brought up as well.

1384
01:34:14,271 --> 01:34:17,517
We're looking at that blockchain
application in the mobile edge compute

1385
01:34:17,517 --> 01:34:19,920
platform for auditing, primarily, right?

1386
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,005
Assurance is a big one.

1387
01:34:22,005 --> 01:34:24,440
On-boarding is another huge one.

1388
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,060
So, we've got to be able to take
that blockchain application and

1389
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:32,618
have it vanilla enough to where we can
apply it to those types of scenarios.

1390
01:34:32,618 --> 01:34:37,320
Or now we we can say, hey look, we can
use zero knowledge proofs to validate

1391
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:41,980
that the identity of this user is who they
say they are without exposing their entire

1392
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:47,160
privacy, but also at the same time
validating that the traffic and

1393
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,750
the data that's coming through
the network is not volatile.

1394
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,790
It's not gonna cause problems.

1395
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:53,990
It's not gonna take the network down.

1396
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:59,040
It doesn't have kinda some nasty payloads
and some stuff in there as well.

1397
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,740
And that really speaks
more to the military and

1398
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:05,300
government applications we're
that seeing for requests for

1399
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:10,160
a verifiable trace routes,
auditing assurance for whether you're

1400
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:15,040
spinning up applications or Kubernetes
clusters or whatever that case might be.

1401
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,600
But All those RF

1402
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:21,410
kind of like spectrum analytics are gonna
have to have auditing trails as well.

1403
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,260
The FCC is pushing for that.

1404
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:27,710
So a lot of these different mandates that
are coming down from not just governments,

1405
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:30,430
but also from private industry as well.

1406
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:34,060
And then also the the governing bodies
like 3GPP and all these other things.

1407
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,390
So we're looking at that.

1408
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:39,300
We're saying hey, you know, next steps for
us is we really have to make

1409
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:43,100
the blockchain application deployed
on the mobile edge compute platform.

1410
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,920
And now we can really open it up to
all those IoT based applications to

1411
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,260
start off with.

1412
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:52,298
Now, because there's a huge developer
pool out there that we're pulling in from

1413
01:35:52,298 --> 01:35:54,419
Nvidia and Intel and some others, right?

1414
01:35:54,419 --> 01:35:57,240
So we're gonna be able to enable those
applications to run at the edge.

1415
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,190
And then that's gonna give us the ability
to work with industry and regulating

1416
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:07,160
bodies and everybody involved, to really
make sure that we can go to the DOD and

1417
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:11,080
say, Hey, here's an option for
you if you want to deploy this on network.

1418
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:17,274
To verify your routes, you can, are all
the different analytics that you need or

1419
01:36:17,274 --> 01:36:20,373
zero proof knowledge kind
of applications as well.

1420
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,980
Thanks, Justin.

1421
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,870
There was a question that I
think you already answered, Dan,

1422
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:31,860
that came up from Dave around
about the traffic analysis.

1423
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,320
But that brought up something for

1424
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:39,245
me that back when Van was first
talking about what became NDN.

1425
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:45,930
I was consulting to this
Airforce thing called TMOS,

1426
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:50,360
which was a satellite based network that
was servicing all these military networks.

1427
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:55,158
And the chief architect of that was
really interested in this idea because of

1428
01:36:55,158 --> 01:37:00,370
the somewhat counter-intuitive idea
that he said, you can send traffic

1429
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:04,420
in all different directions,
not just where you want it to go.

1430
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:07,480
So I guess it'd be like you
sending pizzas all over DC or

1431
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:13,150
something [LAUGH] or
sending pizzas every Friday.

1432
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:16,690
And I mean that's sort of,
we think about efficiency.

1433
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:20,320
But I mean what do you think about
that idea is that that's sort of

1434
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,340
the opposite of efficiency, but it's sort
of obscuring what's really going on.

1435
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,990
>> Yeah, I think that's a great example.

1436
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:34,150
I think there's a lot of interesting
potential there where, and

1437
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:39,090
back to sort of what I've always taken
sort of as the NDN mantra is it's very

1438
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:44,315
hard to hide that volumetrics when
it's a point to point circuit, right.

1439
01:37:44,315 --> 01:37:48,060
Cuz it's hard to say, but
as you point out, right, we could

1440
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,180
with 5G there may be applications
where I've got enough bandwidth and

1441
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:56,580
I actually don't care if I'm
burning some additional bandwidth.

1442
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:01,540
So I don't care if I'm sending
data in random directions.

1443
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:06,290
I like your example of I might just
call up Domino's in Arlington,

1444
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:10,677
Virginia and send pizzas to 20
different directions and who knows.

1445
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,022
So that's a real possibility.

1446
01:38:16,022 --> 01:38:19,480
And so

1447
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:25,100
we're trying to get away from that idea of
being able to easily identify the source.

1448
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:29,890
Another example that's come up is,
yeah, I have all these devices,

1449
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:35,230
they could serve as relays,
they could serve as.

1450
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:39,830
I could talk to Kathy via
anyone on this conference,

1451
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,430
maybe via 20 of you on this conference,
and then.

1452
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:49,230
So it's interesting to see what
you could hide if you put aside

1453
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:55,110
the goal of I don't have limited
bandwidth, I have plenty of bandwidth.

1454
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,711
I don't have a small number of paths,
I have plenty of paths.

1455
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:02,496
Does that give me some new advantages?

1456
01:39:02,496 --> 01:39:05,556
Maybe it does.

1457
01:39:05,556 --> 01:39:06,662
And yeah.

1458
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,845
>> Done on mute.

1459
01:39:08,845 --> 01:39:13,110
Sokwoo, it looks like you
wanted to say something.

1460
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:13,830
>> Yes, thank you.

1461
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:16,450
I want to say because
this is fascinating idea.

1462
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,080
By the way, Dan, welcome back to
federal government, by the way,

1463
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,498
good to have you back.

1464
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:27,260
So from DOD perspective, it may not be,

1465
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:32,490
you may not need to be in the situation
that you have a lot of bandwidth.

1466
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,050
You may have still limited bandwidth but

1467
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:38,112
you were willing to pay for it because
it may be more secure in certain cases.

1468
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:43,570
It's like military is
not always inexpensive,

1469
01:39:43,570 --> 01:39:49,156
the way you need the best and
you need the most secure, most powerful.

1470
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:54,660
So especially for DOD title applications,
makes perfect sense.

1471
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:59,920
Well, you don't have to really think about
efficiency as much as partial world.

1472
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:06,270
And probably you don't want to prioritize
efficiency over other important factors.

1473
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:11,185
So makes perfect sense, and actually just
wanted, I mean this is intriguing you

1474
01:40:11,185 --> 01:40:17,720
interpret that always [LAUGH] because
we've been always thinking about this

1475
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:23,510
we have to talk to talk about the security
of the device or the manufacturer.

1476
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:29,530
That's why we're having all this
discussions about, you know what.

1477
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,880
But that's sort of like
a whack a mole game.

1478
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,130
I mean,
about validate one device is secure, but

1479
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:40,150
there may be other manufacturers that you
may not be able to validate as secure.

1480
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,340
So you cannot, and

1481
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,780
this is sort of like an endless dilemma
that you're gonna eventually face.

1482
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,835
So probably the better approach,

1483
01:40:47,835 --> 01:40:51,300
Dan, as you mentioned is let's
assume that everybody's insecure.

1484
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,060
Let's assume all devices are insecure.

1485
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:59,500
Let's find a way still do
our job on top of this

1486
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,290
less secure, assumed less secure network.

1487
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:04,250
That's a fascinating approach.

1488
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:08,980
That could solve, if you could come up
with something really, really real,

1489
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:13,610
that could solve a lot of
the dilemma that we have right now.

1490
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,390
>> Thank you.

1491
01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:19,622
And a lot of this credit goes to my boss,
Joe Evans, who Dr.

1492
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:23,420
Joe Evans, who's put the big structure for
the program in place.

1493
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:30,790
But I do think this is a,
I do think there's a interesting way to

1494
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:33,980
think about this a little bit differently
and to get out of the old mode.

1495
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:39,490
And that's why I'm particularly
interested in talking on this group,

1496
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:42,870
right, because I think it

1497
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:47,870
also helps to have an architecture
that's thinking along different lines.

1498
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:53,040
And it's a whole different
matter to say how do I hide

1499
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:58,160
the fact that source A is talking to
destination B, when I've kind of got rid

1500
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,470
of the idea of source and destination and
I've changed more to content.

1501
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:09,260
So yeah, so I think there's some
real interesting potential.

1502
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:13,620
So hopefully, hopefully there'll be some
fun stuff that comes out of this and

1503
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,980
we hope to get some interest.

1504
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:19,785
But even if it's not for a DOD setting,
and Sokwoo is exactly right,

1505
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:26,170
at a DOD setting they can pay for,
security is worth the price there.

1506
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:29,120
So we can pay for some of those resources.

1507
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,050
But even in not a VOD setting, right,

1508
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:34,820
this idea of the added
agility in the 5G network.

1509
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:37,220
And can we take advantage of that?

1510
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:40,624
And again,
with this panel being focused on the edge,

1511
01:42:40,624 --> 01:42:46,028
a lot of that communication in those smart
cities, in the vehicles, in the blockchain

1512
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:51,300
authentication is really going to, can
really happen substantially at the edges.

1513
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:55,700
And how does that work?

1514
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:00,290
And it doesn't work well if I put it in
a centralized model where it will all go

1515
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:05,020
back to the, let's send it all back to
the central server and let's do it.

1516
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:07,898
It works well in a distributed manner,

1517
01:43:07,898 --> 01:43:12,793
which I think is well suited to do
a lot of what the NDN communities.

1518
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:19,063
>> Do any of you have
maybe just any particular

1519
01:43:19,063 --> 01:43:24,050
charges that you would say to
the NDN research community?

1520
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:29,521
Things that you feel like
would be particularly

1521
01:43:29,521 --> 01:43:35,002
good to look at that seem
to be neglected areas?

1522
01:43:35,002 --> 01:43:38,144
Go back to that push versus pull model,

1523
01:43:38,144 --> 01:43:43,394
what things would pull you in if
you saw somebody working on that?

1524
01:43:43,394 --> 01:43:45,470
It would make you kind of go, wow.

1525
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:47,770
That's a great thing.

1526
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,806
>> I've got some.

1527
01:43:51,806 --> 01:43:52,880
>> Yeah.
>> Wait, let's see.

1528
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,970
Let's start with Geng Wu,
he hasn't spoken for us yet.

1529
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:58,300
>> Okay, thank you.

1530
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:01,190
So there's several things.

1531
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:10,750
First of all, I would like to echo the and
dance comments.

1532
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:14,270
In fact, even for commercial systems,

1533
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:21,150
the security is increasingly critical
due to the nature of the network and

1534
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:26,280
also the fact that the We
are seeing the rapid

1535
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:32,180
growth of private network,
enterprise network and

1536
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,340
mission critical even from
a commercial point of view.

1537
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,230
So, how to actually make

1538
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:45,530
the insight of secure
the session security connection?

1539
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:50,720
How about directly security data
snd how about protecting privacy?

1540
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:55,670
So those are the one of
the things that really,

1541
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:00,008
we need a research community
is how to father and son.

1542
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:05,860
There are 2, there's a section for
Nikko side to the question I said,

1543
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:10,160
What's the otherwise you have for
the research community?

1544
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:14,430
I think there's 2 ways to look at it.

1545
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:19,520
One way is to understand

1546
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,180
the opportunities that I think
that Dan actually touched on that,

1547
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:31,730
the next generation we are going
to upgrade dramatically

1548
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:36,721
the network performance from
device to network and to fabric.

1549
01:45:36,721 --> 01:45:43,310
So instead of trying to save every bit and
then.

1550
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:47,610
What would it be Indians
technology potential,

1551
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:50,900
because the way is doing things
are dramatically different.

1552
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:56,250
What would the diet gave us
assuming that you are running

1553
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:58,440
the next generation network.

1554
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,690
So that's the last aspect.

1555
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:02,630
To be more specific.

1556
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:10,390
The other aspect is the things that
we were very much interested in.

1557
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:18,790
Is to look at Indian as
a tool as an opportunity

1558
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:24,140
for the network to go a status and
professionalize.

1559
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:30,890
There's this are 2 separate things but
people often call the London together.

1560
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:36,530
Stay less means that since your
service are more localized and

1561
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:43,130
you're going at the edge, etc, etc so and
also we're going very high frequency band,

1562
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:46,870
they have a millimeter wave,
they have a terahertz coming up and

1563
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:54,075
then the connectivity
really is not always there.

1564
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,085
Is probably more opportunistic.

1565
01:46:56,085 --> 01:47:01,165
And then the question is, what are the
technology really to make that work?

1566
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:07,010
And so the night one devices need
to go stay less and session, less.

1567
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:11,130
Well, can you actually
build the security around?

1568
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:17,780
More independent from
the session itself inside of?

1569
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,880
So there's many, many benefits.

1570
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:27,970
I think that my co-panelists already
addressed so I wouldn't, so, repeater.

1571
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:34,210
So I think, one thing we probably
want to work on to the research

1572
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:40,340
community to help us is to understand the
new computing communication data model.

1573
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:45,250
And assuming you have a next
generation platform, and

1574
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:51,040
how you latter would make
the MDN divinely help us to

1575
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,960
build the next generation system and
that benefit everyone.

1576
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,260
Thank you.

1577
01:47:58,260 --> 01:47:58,990
>> Yeah, thank you.

1578
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:03,400
>> Does anybody else have
something to add on that one?

1579
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:08,010
>> Yeah, let me go next, and
then I know Justin wanna jump in too.

1580
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:12,320
But I talk a lot, Justin,
just smile, I like your smile.

1581
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:17,060
And [LAUGH] so gain,
I work on smart cities.

1582
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:24,020
So one of the biggest issues in our city
especially from the perspective of data,

1583
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:31,250
is this lack of interoperability
even inside of the city operation.

1584
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:35,680
So what I mean by that is that the
transportation department may have their

1585
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:43,132
own data sets and their own communication,
and connectivity mechanisms.

1586
01:48:43,132 --> 01:48:45,140
But the packets and

1587
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:48,370
data are not necessarily packed
in that there's no content.

1588
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,800
So typically if you use
this communicate or

1589
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:59,100
system if just inside of department is
okay because it's not from the when

1590
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:03,780
want to create a smart city system which
is cutting across all different sectors?

1591
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:10,960
Suddenly it the data format, or the the
packing of the data becomes a big issue.

1592
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,770
So, I'm not necessarily getting
down to the network layer or

1593
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:20,020
even below I'm not getting the data by
more talking about application level.

1594
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:24,000
But one of the biggest problems
we are seeing is data packets,

1595
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,280
which is typically
the tag with IP address,

1596
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:34,940
some kind of address and the context
over the content is completely separate.

1597
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:39,550
And that is causing a lot of problems
in developing a more holistic,

1598
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:41,970
smart city data exchange network.

1599
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:48,320
So I'm not necessarily thing
that is the problem and

1600
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,160
the network is going to be able
to solve like a silver bullet.

1601
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:57,150
But point is, that's the problem I'm
seeing from the Smart Cities perspective.

1602
01:49:57,150 --> 01:50:00,920
If there is anything that end
in network can contribute.

1603
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:08,170
Addressing it, perhaps bring that concept
into data exchange platform that is

1604
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,940
being developed by so many different
cities and states and governments.

1605
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:16,690
That could potentially change the game.

1606
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:18,420
I'm just throwing that out.

1607
01:50:21,508 --> 01:50:23,690
That's right, Justin [LAUGH]
>> Yeah,

1608
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:28,610
I'll be brief I totally
agree with you guys and

1609
01:50:28,610 --> 01:50:33,350
I think it's really important for
us to focus on on the bigger picture.

1610
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:37,720
Whenever we're looking forward right and
so anywhere we can we can pull those

1611
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:42,980
levers and kind of improve things on
a small scale or even on a big scale.

1612
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:45,170
That's really where we should be focused.

1613
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:50,370
And I think for me, right, because I'm up
in the weeds for the most part right now

1614
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:56,450
currently, but I think the forwarder is
kind of our biggest challenge right now.

1615
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:58,380
And so if we could look at it, you know,

1616
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:02,640
I think it was hit on some of the previous
discussions where we can, you know, it.

1617
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:06,390
And the reason I say that is because
if you look at how 5G works and

1618
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:08,770
dynamic slot you know just
the slicing are long right and

1619
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:12,050
like we're looking at dynamic slicing,
you've got a bunch of other things

1620
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:16,050
that go into the like the the slicing
aspects of it to right?

1621
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:19,730
But moving forward into 5G and
moving forward into those types of

1622
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:22,840
networks where you've got slicing and
you've got CBR s in there too, right?

1623
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:27,680
Where you've got different allocations for
different uses.

1624
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,880
So we're really, we're getting down to
network utilization spectrum utilization,

1625
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,210
but whenever you look at that
from a forwarder standpoint.

1626
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:42,250
Being able to create dynamic faces on the
fly for thousands or millions of devices,

1627
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:45,420
or thousands of millions of users,
and being able to do that and

1628
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:50,660
update the entire network very rapidly and
very quickly in like a 32nd time frame or

1629
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:53,790
less right for new policies and
everything else.

1630
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,540
I think that's where our
substantial challenges are at

1631
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:58,390
just with the Florida right now.

1632
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:03,450
And looking at, you know, how do we
solve that in the in the 5g challenge,

1633
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:06,220
not just from an identity perspective,
right?

1634
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:10,680
Because this really comes back
to fundamentally an identity

1635
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,440
problem in my mind.

1636
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,190
Right?
And that is how do you identify the user?

1637
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:15,160
How do you identify the node?

1638
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:18,000
How do you identify the traffic and so

1639
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,860
really saying If we have a trustful
source, or a trustful destination,

1640
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:27,510
right, it's everything in between that
we have to fix to get it there and

1641
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:33,360
I think Indian is a huge leap forward
to get you know, to get as 90% there.

1642
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,680
I think that there's just
a little bit more we can do

1643
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:41,010
on the forwarder to really
dial in the identity aspects.

1644
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:43,385
And then create the faces
dynamically as well.

1645
01:52:43,385 --> 01:52:46,680
Just,take that load off of developers.

1646
01:52:48,615 --> 01:52:52,850
>> Dan, you have anything you want to add?

1647
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:56,270
>> I think a lot of it's already been
said I'll just add a quick thing in there

1648
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,520
that agree with all the comments there.

1649
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:03,460
I think it's particularly interesting
to see how does availability change and

1650
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,770
can I get a highly available network in
a session less stateless environment and

1651
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:10,160
I think that gives me a lot of

1652
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,230
new opportunities I couldn't
have explored before.

1653
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:17,050
So I, I think, a lot of interesting
directions to pursue here.

1654
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:22,150
Okay, well,
I don't see any other questions.

1655
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:26,670
So I guess Dave had around
had a follow up about

1656
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:31,370
wondering whether we were requiring that
all the NBN routers be physically and

1657
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,820
logically secured but
I don't think that I think that.

1658
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:39,750
As I heard several of you talk about it,
it was more, you know, how do we work

1659
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:45,010
in current environments, and
that did not seem to be the requirement.

1660
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:50,100
But so anyway, I was thinking maybe we
would just go ahead and wrap up and

1661
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:55,130
I don't know if a lot peace on
this we still take a half hour

1662
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:59,620
break or less Somebody want
to give us some guidance?

1663
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:05,666
>> Yeah, I think we were
supposed to come back at 3:15.

1664
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:08,530
So we'll take it 20 minutes and

1665
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:14,319
come back at 3:20
>> Great.

1666
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:16,539
>> All right,
it was very nice meeting you guys.

1667
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:17,759
>> All right, see you guys later.

1668
01:54:17,759 --> 01:54:18,579
>> Nice meeting you.

1669
01:54:18,579 --> 01:54:21,479
>> Thank you very much
to all the panelists.

1670
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:22,969
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.

1671
01:54:22,969 --> 01:54:23,469
>> Bye.

1672
01:54:23,469 --> 01:54:23,969
>> Bye.
