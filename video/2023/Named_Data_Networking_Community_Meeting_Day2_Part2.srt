1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,955
>> So we're back in

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:05,940
first afternoon session
is the panel on

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,860
standardization that
will be chaired

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,200
by Christos Papadopoulos

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,880
from University
of Memphis.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,280
Christos you
want to start?

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,210
>> Thank you. How
are you everybody?

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,490
First of all, thanks to

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,070
the panel for being here

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,440
at making time
to, move closer.

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,265
So now louder,

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,750
thanks to the panel
for being here

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,830
and making time
for this topic.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,880
Do we have the other
two presenters,

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,800
panelists on Zoom.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,110
So can we do a sound check

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,910
for Luca and Kathyayani.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,080
Luca and Kathyayani
you can hear?

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,745
>> I'm Ms. Kathyayani,
can you hear me?

20
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,990
>> Great. Yes,
we can hear you

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,850
Kathyayani. Luca
are you there?

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,425
>> Yes, I'm here.

23
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,990
>> Excellent. And
you can hear us too?

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,370
>> Yes.

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,955
>> Yes.

26
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,420
>> Very good.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,455
>> So the title
of the panel is,

28
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:16,120
might be a little
controversial,

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,570
or at least bringing up

30
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,910
many thoughts that we
have been discussing

31
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,945
and the MDM group
for a long time.

32
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,920
And I hope that
it brings up

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,745
a lot of reactions
that easily intense.

34
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:34,430
I'd like to run
this panel a

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,600
little differently than

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,070
the other panels,
which is,

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,130
I want to encourage
audience participation,

38
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,170
not just on the
Slack channel.

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,810
Slack interaction
has been great.

40
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,220
I've seen a lot
of questions,

41
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,300
great questions coming up

42
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,350
on the Slack channel.

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,480
But I also like to
encourage people

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,640
here and people
who are remotes,

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,619
assuming they have
the audio capability

46
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,575
to ask questions,

47
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,880
we will be monitoring

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,800
the Slack channel
and try to bring

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,750
the questions
that pop up on

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,445
the Slack channel here

51
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:06,410
so we can try to
get them answered.

52
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,120
But please, this is all

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,985
about interaction
and participation.

54
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,065
So let's keep this lively.

55
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,930
Without further ado, let's

56
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,000
go to introduce
our panelists.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,970
So we have Luca
from Cisco,

58
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,685
we all know Luca and

59
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,595
he's been with NDN
for a very long time.

60
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,385
He's perspective is
clearly very valuable.

61
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:30,350
Randy is here in person.

62
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,840
Thank you, Randy.
We've known

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,190
Randy for the
last few years.

64
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,420
You brings in the very

65
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,505
interesting industry
perspective.

66
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,560
Very happy to
have him here.

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
Suzanne is here in person,

68
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,630
and Suzanne is the
only person who may

69
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,255
not be as familiar with
NBN as the others,

70
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:49,145
but she does work
in standards.

71
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:49,880
So I figured if

72
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,020
we're talking
about standards,

73
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,685
we should have a
standards person

74
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,170
here to guide us.

75
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,640
And that will be a

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,290
role here to keep
us in check.

77
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,000
And we have Kathyayani
from Intel.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,630
Kathyayani has been
working with MDN for

79
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,550
several years
now as part of

80
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,950
the wind projects,
if I'm correct.

81
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
And she's also bringing

82
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,580
another industry
perspective.

83
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,620
Now note that we
have a lot of

84
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,240
industry representation

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,040
here that was on purpose.

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,050
Because we have
been talking about

87
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,000
MDN for a very long time,

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,685
asking the question, how
do we commercialize?

89
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,050
How do we move it forward?

90
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,570
How do we bring it to
market and so forth?

91
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,555
So that was by design.

92
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:33,125
Disclaimer that I'd
like to bring up is

93
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,030
everybody here speaks on

94
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,440
behalf of their
own selves,

95
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,420
especially the
industry folks.

96
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,295
They are not expressing

97
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:43,270
their company's opinions,
just their own.

98
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,550
Great. So I wanted to
give the opportunity to

99
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,535
everybody to briefly
introduce themselves.

100
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:50,960
And if you want,

101
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,770
you can also state
upfront your position.

102
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,630
So let's start with Randy.

103
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,970
> Sure. Is this on?

104
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,830
>> Sure.

105
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,640
>> So I'm Randy King,
CTO of Operant.

106
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
We're a small
company where

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,525
seed round funded
13 people current

108
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,535
and we've been
working on Indian

109
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,350
primarily with UCLA team

110
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,865
for about five years.

111
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,610
Our focus is on
energy networking

112
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,370
like cybersecurity
for utilities,

113
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,800
primarily, also

114
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,395
renewable energy that's
widely distributed.

115
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:27,020
So a lot of us came
from a background and

116
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,670
communications plus
the background

117
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,440
and the solar
energy industry.

118
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,545
So that's our
base business.

119
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,470
My interest here is
because our business plan

120
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,730
is based on what
we're calling

121
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,065
an open core model.

122
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,910
So if I had slides,

123
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,800
I'd make three
concentric rings

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,900
on them in the center 1,

125
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,610
which is what we
call the core.

126
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,035
And that's the open source

127
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,415
networking libraries

128
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,750
and the transports

129
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,675
that this
community builds.

130
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,500
And so this is

131
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,149
the center of
our technology

132
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,575
stack in a sense.

133
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:00,095
And the ring around it

134
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:05,315
is the set of
tools and APIs and

135
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:07,340
higher-level things
that are like

136
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,500
middle level stuff that we

137
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,910
use to provide value in

138
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,510
a business in a product
development sense.

139
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,330
And then the outer ring
is application space.

140
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,110
So we might focus on
energy, markets stuff,

141
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,330
but maybe in the future
people will work

142
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,440
on health care
or something

143
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,210
using these inner rings.

144
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,370
So the benefit
of the open core

145
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,810
is that we get,

146
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,765
a really key thing
for us is that we get

147
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,640
renewability and
improvement of

148
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,930
the security that's built

149
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,490
into the core stuff.

150
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,669
And because in the end
tends to encapsulate

151
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:41,810
all the security and

152
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,340
security support
functions in

153
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,630
the lower level
networking.

154
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,970
This is particularly
effective because

155
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,300
our customers want no
security by obscurity.

156
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,960
They want reviewable,
stable code.

157
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,925
So that's where we get

158
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,120
benefit out of
standardization of this core.

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,370
And I think in

160
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,110
the future we'd like
to imagine there's

161
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,610
a true open
source community

162
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,230
contributing to that
core and there's

163
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,790
some set of
processes to be

164
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,310
developed to monitor
and integrate that.

165
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,520
So that's my
opening statement.

166
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,620
>> Great. Very
well said, Randy.

167
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,760
Thank you. Suzanne?

168
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,240
>> [LAUGHTER].

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,575
I obviously have
cursed microphones.

170
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:31,970
I'm Suzanne Lightman.

171
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,820
I work in the Computer
Security Division

172
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,415
here at NIST.

173
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:38,825
And my expertise is

174
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:42,110
automotive and industrial
cybersecurity.

175
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,000
And I'm mostly
on this panel,

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,630
I think because I
have experience with

177
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,340
four or five

178
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,620
different standard
organizations.

179
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,790
I've worked on what

180
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,995
are called horizontal
standards,

181
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,630
which are standards
that are not

182
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,075
specific to any
particular industry.

183
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,190
And I've worked on
vertical standards,

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,270
which are
standards that are

185
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,815
specific to industries.

186
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:08,015
So I have extensive
experience across a range

187
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,685
of standard development
organizations

188
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,940
and because I
work at NIST,

189
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,630
a very clear
understanding of

190
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,740
what standards can
and cannot give you.

191
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,620
>> Great. Thank
you Suzanne.

192
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,495
When I met Suzanne,

193
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,300
I was at DHS and I

194
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,760
remember having
a conversation

195
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,490
that went something like,

196
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,270
do you know how
standards work?

197
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,830
And I think I gave
her some answer

198
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,600
which was completely
out of the blue.

199
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,890
And then she's like,
let me tell you

200
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,675
how they really work.

201
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:37,760
I really appreciate
you being here.

202
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,890
Going to our remote
participants.

203
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,220
Kathyayani, would
you mind going next?

204
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,735
>> Sure. Thanks Christos.

205
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,415
I'm Kathyayani
Srikanteswara.

206
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:51,290
I'm a principal
engineer at Intel,

207
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,095
working in Intel Labs.

208
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:54,810
And as Christos
has mentioned,

209
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,550
I was the PI for

210
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,245
the Intel NSFICN main
centre from 2017-2020.

211
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:04,430
But for the last
six years or so

212
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,545
have been looking at

213
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,090
India and in

214
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,010
particular commercial
applications

215
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,840
of Indian way.
Can we use it?

216
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,525
And we narrowed down

217
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,730
to the edge applications.

218
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,590
And in some sense,

219
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,390
even though Indian was
originally designed

220
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,820
largely for content
or fixed networks,

221
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,290
we felt it had a lot

222
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,569
of potential for compute,

223
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,700
or were dynamic networks,

224
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,750
dynamic resources,

225
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,670
multi-tenant
resources and so on.

226
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,910
And that's what we
have been looking

227
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,080
at for the last six
or seven years or so.

228
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,360
And in terms of my view
of standardization or

229
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,650
taking a step
back or looking

230
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,850
at a slightly
larger picture

231
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,680
of what does it

232
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,944
take for an Indian to
become commercial?

233
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,670
And why hasn't it

234
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,620
become commercial
on a large scale?

235
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,075
Yes, there are, of course,

236
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,635
as we have people here

237
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,330
who have been
looking at it,

238
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,755
but why hasn't it

239
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,660
then adopted on
a larger scale?

240
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,460
And one thing I
wanted to point

241
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,500
out was when we have

242
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,380
a new technology
or a protocol or

243
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,820
an algorithm for which

244
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,394
you don't have a solution.

245
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,330
You've never
seen a solution.

246
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,180
Then the minute
academia comes

247
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,685
up with a new protocol
or an algorithm,

248
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:23,149
industry tries to
absorb it immediately,

249
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,550
devil upon it, and so on.

250
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,075
But in this slightly
different space here,

251
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:31,580
where even though it

252
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,175
may not be optimal
or far from optimal,

253
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,870
there are ways of
doing a lot of

254
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,940
the networking and
networking data movement

255
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,535
compute solutions.

256
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:45,170
And a lot of them, I will

257
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,970
say that they are
far from optimal,

258
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,625
but when there is
a way to do it,

259
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,210
there is a lot much
more bigger barrier

260
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,890
for adoption of a
newer technology.

261
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,750
And then in those
situations,

262
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,020
the key becomes
the benefits.

263
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,800
Can you show orders
of magnitude?

264
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,330
And I'm talking about not

265
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,535
just even one or two
weights like 10x, 100x.

266
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,650
And I know some
of the benefits

267
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,405
cannot be quantified.

268
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:10,160
But the idea is the same.

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,290
Is there an area or

270
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,060
an application
where it's really

271
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,440
hard to do the
way we do things

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,735
now and can Indian help?

273
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:19,025
And in that respect,

274
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:21,140
I think I can
kinda see where

275
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,370
he's coming from as well

276
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,765
as some standardization.

277
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,190
If you have something
to start with,

278
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,305
it's not the only thing,

279
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,640
but it can certainly help.

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,895
But when you have
some form of

281
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:34,010
a standard or
specification that you can

282
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,245
benchmark against
and compare.

283
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,730
It makes things a
lot easier and I

284
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,800
think that's
where I stand.

285
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,920
>> Great. Thank
you Kathyayani.

286
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,480
So Luca I'd like to

287
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,970
go for you to go next,
if you're ready?

288
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,850
>> My name is
Luca Muscariello,

289
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,470
a principal
engineer at Cisco

290
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,475
during last seven years,

291
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:04,165
before that I was working

292
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,295
in a telco business.

293
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:09,880
And I've been working
on this topic since

294
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,720
2010 in different areas.

295
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,075
While working at Cisco

296
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,520
I've been working mostly

297
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,640
in incubation and product

298
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,710
creation based on ICN.

299
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,160
More recently on
real-time communications,

300
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,735
especially WebEx, WebRTC,

301
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:36,640
also mobile gaming but

302
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,150
also for web free
applications.

303
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,105
And I think that's it.

304
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,470
I don't want to
[LAUGHTER] bore

305
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,320
everybody with
a longer story,

306
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,820
but happy to be here.

307
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,750
>> Thanks Luca. So I

308
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,579
think we need the volume

309
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,160
a little bit up on
the remote people.

310
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,000
I think the volume from

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,260
the remote people
is a little low.

312
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,830
I think we need

313
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,000
to increase the
volume a little bit

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,110
from the remote people.

315
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,475
So moving on to

316
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:17,950
the first
question which is

317
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,770
what is a panel
started asking.

318
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,589
So is it time
to standardize?

319
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,180
And I know this is
a question that in

320
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,460
the NDN group we
have been talking

321
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,110
about for a long time

322
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,610
and mostly in

323
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,530
the context of
commercialization.

324
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,320
And it also in some
form it also came up at

325
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,460
the lessons learned panel

326
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,605
that we had yesterday.

327
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:41,770
So when I ask about

328
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,900
standardization
I mean that

329
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,070
in the broader sense.

330
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,260
So it could be
standardization in terms of

331
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,570
standards and RFCs
and so forth.

332
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,370
But it could also be

333
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,350
a specification
which means we

334
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,580
don't have to go through

335
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,310
the formal process of
standards and so forth.

336
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,080
In the arguments
that we had in

337
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,770
the past for and against
standardization,

338
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,525
I think everybody
knows them.

339
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,760
Let me just remind
them what they are,

340
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,560
at least the two
main arguments.

341
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,020
The argument for
standardization

342
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,360
obviously is to help
with commercialization,

343
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,190
help with adoption,
and all the good

344
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,410
things that come with
standardization.

345
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,110
The argument
against was a fear

346
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,575
of freezing the
specification and not

347
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,180
allowing improvements or

348
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,235
further research into

349
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:30,145
NDN that at the end

350
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:33,100
after many years we
may come to regret.

351
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,530
So think this is

352
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,905
the shoe key thoughts
that we've had.

353
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,350
I felt that people have
any other thoughts

354
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,705
I would love to hear them.

355
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:48,910
And then in addition
to these questions,

356
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,935
if we decide
that it is time

357
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:53,140
to look into some form
of standardization,

358
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,555
then the question is,
who should do it?

359
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:58,570
Who should pursue it?
And by who I mean,

360
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,775
the academics, industry,

361
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,535
both, and so forth.

362
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,590
So I wanted to have

363
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,185
Luca kick off the
discussion on this

364
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:11,530
because he has been
quite vocal on

365
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,525
the email exchange
that we've had and I

366
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,710
know in the past you

367
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,240
had a lot of
strong opinions.

368
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
So Luca, would you

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,900
mind presenting your
thoughts on this?

370
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,400
>> Well, the
topic is not new.

371
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
I think in the community
we've being going

372
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,400
back-and-forth on this

373
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,510
question several times.

374
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,770
Is it time to
standardize or not?

375
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,430
And I think that I changed

376
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,960
my mind several times.

377
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,330
First time I remember
the discussion

378
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,210
2012 when Park started

379
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,730
the first industrial
consortium,

380
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,360
I was working for a
telco at that time.

381
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,020
People were already
asking themselves,

382
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,060
should we
standardize or not.

383
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,300
And then later on

384
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,130
there was this
conversation

385
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,420
between CCN versus

386
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,050
NDN for a very
long time which

387
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,130
made that undoable
for many reasons.

388
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,830
And more recently
my opinion

389
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,680
moving to something

390
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,240
that is more
business-driven,

391
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,685
like why would
you standardize?

392
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,560
Standardize is
very complex and

393
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,245
very expensive
for everybody.

394
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:36,970
Unless you have ongoing
revenue streams to

395
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,535
justify the need for

396
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,535
a specification plus
interoperability,

397
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:46,585
standardization is
not actually needed.

398
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:49,360
And this is also

399
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,580
something that
is coming from

400
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,410
other communities
where they

401
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,450
can successfully
build a community

402
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,330
without standards
like for instance

403
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,565
the very successful
Cloud Native

404
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:03,790
Computing Foundations
where you

405
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,860
don't have any standard
and people can

406
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,040
collaborate
around code base.

407
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,505
In general I've noticed

408
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:18,490
during the last I
would say 20 years

409
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,900
that networks in
particular with

410
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,910
some very specific
exception

411
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,050
related to security is

412
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,820
not actually
something that

413
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,500
really need standards
to move on.

414
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,060
Like overlays can work

415
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,295
without any
standardization effort.

416
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,790
Interoperability
can be managed

417
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,950
by partners without having

418
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,770
a standard to do that.

419
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,860
And so I'm skeptical

420
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,050
about the need for
standardization in

421
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,315
general from a
business perspective

422
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,090
and I'm a little
skeptical in

423
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,055
particular for
this community

424
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,820
for a reason which
is mostly related

425
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,800
to the fact that
you really need

426
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,340
to share change control

427
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,480
of the technology and

428
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,560
essentially get
feedback from

429
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,390
the users and essentially

430
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,110
take into account

431
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,445
the feedback
from the users.

432
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,660
And so which implies

433
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,270
adoption to get
that feedback

434
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,100
and change the
technology so that

435
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,455
it matches the
expectation of the users.

436
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,885
So in a way it's a
chicken egg problem

437
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:25,645
where if you don't
have that option

438
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,085
you don't have users

439
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,390
providing feedback changes

440
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,590
in technology
until it gets

441
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,225
to a stable situations.

442
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,590
And so at that point

443
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,030
you may think about
standardization.

444
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,890
Ensure standardization
should happen

445
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,215
after adoption
and not before.

446
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:44,140
And for this
specific community

447
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,310
I don't think we
are already in

448
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,570
the curve of adoption.

449
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,105
I will stop here
for the moment.

450
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:56,540
>> Great. Thank
you Luca. Randy.

451
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,260
>> Well, so I think
I'm just going

452
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,820
to basically
agree with Luca,

453
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,710
but in a more
simple minded way,

454
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,840
which is, I wasn't

455
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,920
really sure of
the difference

456
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
between a
specification and

457
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,190
a standardization
so I looked it up.

458
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,440
And the first
Google entry,

459
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,390
because I have a short
attention span was

460
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,730
the specifications
are limited

461
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,650
to a specific
project or agency,

462
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,870
standards are
specifications

463
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,670
that are recognized as

464
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,140
the most practical
solution

465
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,130
that is agreed upon

466
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,510
by a recognized authority

467
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,965
for a recurring problem.

468
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,870
If I'd known I was
sitting next to Suzanne,

469
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,295
I wouldn't try this.

470
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:33,925
But if you pick some
of that is valuable,

471
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,380
I would point out
that there are

472
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,940
no recurring
problems solved

473
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,515
by NDN right now.

474
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:42,280
There really aren't
any recognized experts

475
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,310
to standardize on these
recurring problems.

476
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,900
So I would agree with Luca

477
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,805
that first you need those,

478
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:51,250
and that would apply
some adoption.

479
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,260
I mentioned this to our

480
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,420
VP Product at
lunch and he said,

481
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,190
there won't be standards
until there were

482
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,510
big companies who
think there's

483
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,325
something here worth
fighting over.

484
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:03,770
And I thought that was
a good summary of it.

485
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,140
>> Great. Thank you,
Randy. So Kathyayani,

486
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,850
can we get your opinion

487
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,995
and then we'll
come to Suzanne.

488
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,930
>> Sure. So one
thing I wanted

489
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,030
to just share
is I heard you

490
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,370
mentioned earlier as
one of the reasons or

491
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,800
the fear of
standardization

492
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,110
has been that we freeze

493
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,095
technology or innovation.

494
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:29,830
And just wanted to
clarify that that is not

495
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,350
the case if history
has anything to

496
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,140
do with it. Look
at the cell level.

497
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,970
We went all the
way from 1G to

498
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,145
we're now thinking of 6G.

499
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,410
So even if there is
a standard, yes,

500
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,330
you will keep
innovating beyond that

501
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,365
and there'll be
a new standard,

502
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:45,595
same with Wi-Fi.

503
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:48,640
Personally, I thought
we had 802.11n,

504
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,020
and then we had the ACAD

505
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,715
and I thought
we'd be done now.

506
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,380
We were far from them.

507
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,480
So just wanted to
point out that

508
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,995
that fear we probably
need not have.

509
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:03,220
The other thing I just
wanted to share was,

510
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,005
I agree In general, yes,

511
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,550
the whole adoption

512
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,140
versus standardization
there.

513
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,280
And in general, yes, if

514
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,290
their people are
dying to adopt

515
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,060
the technologies
to standardization

516
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,385
almost happens
instantaneously.

517
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:21,880
I agree with a lot
of things Luca said,

518
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,730
but also wanted
to add that in,

519
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,325
let's say cloud-native or

520
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,950
some of these
other areas, yes,

521
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,960
we don't have an
official standard

522
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,520
but what happened was like

523
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,180
Docker or
Kubernetes became

524
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,875
the de facto standard.

525
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,980
And everybody now
calibrates to that.

526
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,560
So if you're looking
at, how do you do it?

527
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,925
Assume it's Kubernetes,

528
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,500
assume it's Docker
containers.

529
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,380
And that's evolved
organically

530
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,460
as the de facto standards.

531
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,870
So even though it

532
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,235
wasn't officially
a standard

533
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:58,730
it did happen
in some manner.

534
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,910
>> Great. Thank
you, Kathyayani.

535
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,710
Suzanne, do you
want to jump in?

536
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,125
>> You want me
to start now.

537
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,050
There's some things that
standards can do and

538
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,215
there's something that
standards can't do.

539
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,630
The first thing
I will say is

540
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,555
a standard requires
a group of

541
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,910
experts who come to

542
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,845
a consensus on what

543
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,390
has to be in
the standards.

544
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,470
So you have to
have the group

545
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,610
of experts first.

546
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,920
Also, a standard generally

547
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,620
is not a how it's a what.

548
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,335
It isn't an
instruction manual.

549
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:42,805
It's telling you what
you have to have,

550
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,890
but not how you
have to get it.

551
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,540
This is how we
wind up having

552
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,610
standards about
risk assessments,

553
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,580
but everybody uses a
different methodology.

554
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,590
So if you're growing

555
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,030
an issue where you're

556
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,890
looking at things
and saying,

557
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,115
these are things that
you have to have and

558
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,895
ordering to
participate in NDN,

559
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:10,435
that would be the
basis of a standard.

560
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:12,250
If you are still at

561
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,005
the point where
you're saying,

562
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:17,580
we don't agree on
what you have to

563
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,310
have or we don't

564
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,260
have to interact
enough that it makes

565
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,320
a difference if we
have different things,

566
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,670
then you don't have to

567
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,625
worry about a standard.

568
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:34,660
But I will say
that you probably

569
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
want to set yourself
on a pathway to

570
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,320
standards because

571
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,390
standards do make
things more,

572
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,430
for lack of a better
word, respectable.

573
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,365
For industries,
when they say,

574
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,520
see their standards,

575
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
interoperability
standards,

576
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,285
operations standards,
then they can say,

577
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:55,990
so if I buy this
product that uses NDN,

578
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,970
and then I buy
another product

579
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,305
that uses NDN,

580
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:02,680
they will interoperate
and I will not have to

581
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,180
go and find somebody
to do something

582
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,850
very expensive to
make them all work.

583
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,070
Those are the kind of

584
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,125
advantages and there's
a runway to standards.

585
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,460
For example, it may be

586
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,635
time for NDN to
start looking for

587
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:19,935
a standards development
organization where

588
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:22,140
eventually you might have

589
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,610
the experts that will

590
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,324
then create the standards.

591
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:26,980
IEEE, for instance,

592
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,185
will do projects that

593
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:30,760
eventually get
to standards.

594
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,260
An example is Obtain

595
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,540
that winded its
way as a project.

596
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,485
This is an update standard

597
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,570
in the automotive
industry that started out

598
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,090
as a project and
then slid into

599
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,680
IEEE as a project and

600
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,960
is now slowly
standardizing.

601
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,045
So there is a very long
runway to standards.

602
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:55,150
Although it's not time
to have a standard,

603
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,240
it may be time to start
looking at where you

604
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,360
would be if you wanted
to standardize.

605
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,040
>> Great. Thank you.
So there's also

606
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,555
this question between

607
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:09,250
standardization
and specification.

608
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,010
Thank you Randy for
looking it up on Google.

609
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,220
And I think the way
we were looking

610
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,630
at this question is

611
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,655
maybe we're not
ready for standards.

612
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,950
It sounds like
something very finite,

613
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,860
very final, if you like.

614
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,400
But maybe we should
start looking at putting

615
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,120
together a
specification for NDN.

616
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,650
And I'll leave
that open as

617
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,240
to exactly what
that means.

618
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,100
But I think we

619
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,155
were thinking that
we need to have

620
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:41,350
something that people can

621
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,980
coalesce around and
have a common goal.

622
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,120
>> I think your microphone

623
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,080
might have
stopped working.

624
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,630
>> I think I might have

625
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,670
been keeping it away from.

626
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,280
Suzanne, going
back to you.

627
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,900
So in the path for
standards, as you said,

628
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,200
do you see
specification as

629
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,315
a bus stop going there?
How do you see that?

630
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:11,860
>> I will say depending on

631
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,810
what organization
you're with

632
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,370
, standards development
organization.

633
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,960
Specification
isn't that much

634
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,910
less than the standard.

635
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,340
They're generally
a little quicker

636
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,840
but there's still based on

637
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,955
consensus and on having

638
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,230
experts come together

639
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,610
to talk about something.

640
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,270
They're generally more
limited in scope.

641
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,905
They generally have

642
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:34,585
a quicker development time

643
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:35,950
that would be three years

644
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,525
as opposed to five years.

645
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,880
Standards are not fast.

646
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,670
And they're
generally designed

647
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,770
with a limited lifetime.

648
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,690
So the idea is
that they are

649
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,000
a step onto a standard.

650
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,680
So if you were to do

651
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,600
a specific technical
specification,

652
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
a TS, as it's
called in ISO or

653
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,440
a publicly available
specification.

654
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,155
I think that's
what ICE calls it.

655
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,720
I'm not sure what
IEEE calls it.

656
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,585
It's kind of like
a baby steps

657
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:06,250
towards a standard,

658
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,900
but they would
expect you to then

659
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,570
go on and standardize.

660
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,390
So you would need to
look at this and see,

661
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,250
is there a portion of NDN

662
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,155
that would benefit from

663
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,420
everybody saying this is

664
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,910
what you have to have.

665
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,160
>> Great. Thank
you. I think that

666
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,795
was the point that
Kathyayani made,

667
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,090
which is, if you

668
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,470
standardize it
doesn't mean

669
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,550
the end of the work.

670
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,060
You can standardize
in different phases.

671
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,145
Great. So let's move
to the next question.

672
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:40,900
This is something that

673
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,015
came up again on email.

674
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:45,385
And I think we had

675
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:47,170
some sort of a
general agreement

676
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,460
from all the participants

677
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,610
that in order to
move forward with

678
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,695
something that
the industry

679
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,900
would want to use,

680
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,320
we need to have something

681
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,850
like an industry
consortium

682
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,575
to take on the work.

683
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,570
And in the NDN team,

684
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,700
we have been talking
for a long time about

685
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,580
the lack of manpower
to create code,

686
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,800
proper code, fast code,

687
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,615
whatever you
want to call it,

688
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,985
but I think there was also

689
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:20,800
the thought
that academics,

690
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,325
graduate students, the
academia in general

691
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,020
would not be able
to undertake

692
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,165
the task of
creating the code,

693
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:32,035
the products that we
want to have as output.

694
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:34,450
And looking at
other efforts

695
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,435
that were successful
and progressed,

696
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:40,170
it seems to me
that there was in

697
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,150
most cases there was

698
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,580
some an industry
consortium that took

699
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,030
over the project and
pushed it forward.

700
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,280
In order to have that,

701
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,900
I think all of
these consortiums

702
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,275
had a few common themes.

703
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:57,275
For example they

704
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,645
always answered
the question,

705
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,195
what is the perceived
value of this?

706
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:05,290
And everybody
agreed on that one.

707
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,390
Then if we go
towards in this

708
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,490
industry consortium then
this other questions

709
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,570
that come up and I'm just

710
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,950
listing a few
of them here,

711
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,375
who should be on it?

712
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,535
Should we partner
with an organization

713
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,365
like what Suzanne said?

714
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:19,000
And then finally,
what should be

715
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,535
the output of
the consortium?

716
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,680
So with that very
brief introduction,

717
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,810
I'm going to let our
panelists comment

718
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,000
on this idea of an
industry consortium.

719
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,280
And I'm going to
circle back and start

720
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,130
again with Luca,
if you're ready.

721
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,560
>> Yes, I'm ready.

722
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,970
Where do you want
me to start?

723
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,380
>> So in general,
your thoughts about

724
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,300
industry consortiums
and whether these

725
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,310
will be an appropriate
path for NDN.

726
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,220
>> Industrial they're many

727
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,350
and I've participated
myself in many

728
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,610
of them in the past in

729
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,730
different contexts
beyond the NDN ICN.

730
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,085
And they are useful
because it's a place

731
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:06,760
where the industry can

732
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,900
meet and discuss about

733
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,460
the needs of customers,

734
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,620
partners, those who

735
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,970
build and those
who operate

736
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,980
the technology and so

737
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,930
you get the feedback
and it's very useful.

738
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,490
And in some cases,

739
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,970
I've been active in
the telco industry,

740
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,055
in Broadband Forum
or in mobile space.

741
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:32,290
You have a running
business there.

742
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,195
So you have partners
building equipment,

743
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:40,300
operators deploying
equipment and

744
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,120
so you have a very
large cost and

745
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,475
so the standard
is necessary

746
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:49,345
with Lockean, etc.

747
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:51,280
It has been already raised

748
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,305
here in this panel.

749
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,880
So it's very useful to

750
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,750
have in industry
consortium.

751
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,735
And the reason why
industry meet in

752
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:01,510
this fora is that

753
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,180
there is a business
behind it.

754
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,860
And so they meet
because it's required

755
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,570
to make the business

756
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,410
continue to grow or
continuing to work.

757
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,880
And so that you
have running

758
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
revenue streams and so you

759
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,580
want them to continue.

760
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,170
The incentives are very

761
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,460
clear for
everybody to stay

762
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,370
there. I go back
to adoption.

763
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,230
If you have adoption,

764
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,675
especially the
early stage,

765
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,600
you have the industry
that is willing

766
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,280
to invest because there

767
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,560
are opportunities
to create revenues.

768
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,095
And once those revenue
streams are triggered,

769
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:42,340
then you meet in these
fora to keep them

770
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,020
working as a continuum

771
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,260
in the case of
IEEE, Ethernet,

772
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,730
Wi-Fi than OWELL,

773
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,100
plus three GPP than OWELL,

774
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,280
the business is very
large and everybody's

775
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,605
there and keep
the standard of

776
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,805
living because there are

777
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:58,990
upgrades with technology,

778
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,310
but the business
is there to

779
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,025
find all that effort

780
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,560
and technology
evolution to

781
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,190
the different technologies
that I mentioned.

782
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,450
In the case of NDN is

783
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,940
different because
you don't have

784
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,030
recognized business that

785
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,430
can make that possible.

786
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,100
And so we're still at

787
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,630
the early stage if

788
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,235
you think about
the Gardner,

789
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:25,840
that cycle curve,
we are still

790
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,295
at the early stage
of that curve.

791
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:31,330
We are not very far
from the plateau and

792
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,949
so every single consortium

793
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:37,060
that I've seen
in the case of

794
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,850
IC NDN are
mostly research.

795
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,645
So that's where
standard is less.

796
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:45,670
You have less
incentives to push

797
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,800
a standard because you

798
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,120
don't even know if the
business is going to

799
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,610
start in the year
and for year or so.

800
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,920
Yes, consortia.

801
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,910
Industrial consortiums are

802
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,130
useful but they need

803
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:06,200
to be driven by a
business opportunity.

804
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,950
>> Great. Thanks
Luka. So Randy,

805
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,515
you have seen a
business opportunity

806
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,520
clearly with NDN and
that's why you're here.

807
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,815
Do you want to
comment on that?

808
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,840
>> I think it's
an interesting.

809
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,610
I'm really happy to follow

810
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,975
Lucas comments
because he's

811
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:27,970
ahead of me on
this thinking,

812
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,120
I think I can
follow along with,

813
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,100
we know it's not time for

814
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,420
standardization
because there aren't

815
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,145
big companies
fighting over this

816
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:38,800
so is the path for
standardization

817
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,780
helpful to
actually get over

818
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,190
the adoption barriers is

819
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,095
more of the
interesting question.

820
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,460
And so I've been thinking

821
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,870
about it in that terms.

822
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,505
And if you just

823
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:50,890
blur your eyes to
standardization and say it

824
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,840
includes the path
that Suzanne

825
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,940
was talking about
then I think

826
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,425
there's value of providing

827
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:57,790
what I call stability and

828
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,830
visibility for the
protocol because it

829
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,485
increases what you
call the respect.

830
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:05,380
When we go to a
customer who we're

831
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,105
engaging with as
the visionaries

832
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:08,005
in the customer,

833
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,700
they're not the
people that

834
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,934
do the day-to-day
work initially.

835
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:15,385
And so when we engage
with constellation,

836
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:18,130
we engage with
people who said,

837
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,840
we have solutions today,

838
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,300
but they will not
scale to 10 years out.

839
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,430
We need to be thinking
about what we

840
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,440
can do then.
That's visionary.

841
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,210
They need to bring

842
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,130
our proposal to
their management

843
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,670
to engage with
us and bring

844
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,140
us the first
project that could

845
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,495
lead to the future
that's bigger business.

846
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,910
And so we have to
give those guys

847
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,175
internal sales
tools that work

848
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:46,870
to provide a
respectability

849
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,145
of what we're doing.

850
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:50,020
And there are things

851
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,700
that seem to be
on the path to

852
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,075
standards and I
listed white papers,

853
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,805
human-readable
specifications,

854
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:01,160
stable and
reviewable codebase.

855
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,450
Those things are examples

856
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,175
of today to some degree.

857
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,330
There's a couple of things

858
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,410
that really don't exist.

859
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,365
Example apps that engage
real customers, no.

860
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,300
There's toy apps
which are great

861
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,405
for developers but
not for customers.

862
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:17,020
And there are

863
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,880
very few industry
business cases

864
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,350
that anybody can point to.

865
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,210
And so we need

866
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,980
to work on those
things which I

867
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,720
believe are on the path

868
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,460
to what we want
to do someday,

869
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,930
which would be
something so

870
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,850
valuable that people
will fight over.

871
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,310
And so I have

872
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,320
one small success
along the way,

873
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,910
which was we funded

874
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,160
an Internet draft that
Kathy Nichols and

875
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,630
Van Jacobson wrote on

876
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,160
deft as part of

877
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,185
a DOE project
that we're doing.

878
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:47,080
And it's a very good
intermediate step in

879
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,700
my mind between
a white paper

880
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,825
and a specification.

881
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,130
It's more detailed than

882
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,890
a specification
presented to

883
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,660
the IETF community but in

884
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,575
a request for
comment form notice,

885
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,615
proposed standards
of track.

886
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:05,200
And so I think
it's been going to

887
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,150
be quite useful
with our customers

888
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,440
because their experts can

889
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,385
look at it and go like,

890
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:12,250
this is put in front of

891
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,660
a respectable
community and

892
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,805
written clearly by
obvious experts.

893
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,920
And so that thing we

894
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,335
can use to build
our credibility.

895
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,910
And then that'll get us

896
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,260
to the visionaries to do

897
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,060
their internal sales
that may lead to

898
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,625
the actual business.
So I'll stop there.

899
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,610
>> Great. Thank
you. So just

900
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,110
to follow one on that one.

901
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,770
So it's really great
that you guys have had

902
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,570
so much success and
you're able to convince

903
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,850
your customers of
the value for this.

904
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,425
If we wanted to move
towards a consortium,

905
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,120
then which means bringing

906
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,205
other companies
into place,

907
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,690
companies that
would recognize

908
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,160
the value just
like you did.

909
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,400
Who would you like to see?

910
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,335
And I'm not talking
about companies.

911
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm talking about what is

912
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,670
would it help you and

913
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,140
what would be the
way to do it?

914
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,410
>> I think the community

915
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,900
here, like our company,

916
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,190
has been until recently as

917
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,410
lacking a set
expertise in how to

918
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,075
explain things to people

919
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:21,249
in an understandable
format.

920
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:22,900
And there's a big
difference between

921
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,910
having the interest and

922
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,560
patience that takes
to engage with

923
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,500
the research community
and a business case.

924
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,620
And the government can

925
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,770
help fund programs
that make it better.

926
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,890
Some startups will engage,

927
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,180
like we have in some

928
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,815
researchers in
big companies

929
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,795
have the patients and

930
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:45,835
the intelligence
to do all this.

931
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,190
And so what I

932
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,590
think we want to
[NOISE] excuse me,

933
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,825
want to do is

934
00:36:55,825 --> 00:37:00,250
lower the effort required

935
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,780
to understand what's here.

936
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,125
With us, we hire
product people.

937
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,060
There's a whole set
of experts that

938
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,085
do this for industry.

939
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:14,320
What's the equivalent
in academia

940
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,614
to make something
more available?

941
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:19,490
That would be more of
a question for you.

942
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,830
>> Great. Thank
you. Kathy,

943
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,070
I want to get back
to your thoughts.

944
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,870
>> Sure.

945
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,610
>> Go ahead.

946
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,580
>> I've been trying to
keep track of those.

947
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,200
So maybe I'll start

948
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,990
with the last
comment that Randy

949
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,910
just made and it's

950
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,460
about yes making
adoption easier.

951
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,245
I think that's the
critical part.

952
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:44,005
And also goes back to

953
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:46,120
the standards

954
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,860
versus specification
versus code.

955
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,320
It doesn't have to
be in the form of

956
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
a 3GPP solar standards

957
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,850
that we have those
documents, that you have,

958
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,380
the code can definitely be

959
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,900
standards too
and especially

960
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,600
if it's associated with

961
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,190
how do I couldn't work.

962
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,535
I have this application
that I, without NDN.

963
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,580
I want to implement
this using

964
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,945
NDN and some of all the

965
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,270
security features
that I want to use,

966
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,530
all those techniques that

967
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,180
NDN provides, caching,

968
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,340
security, all the
other benefits,

969
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,690
resource discovering.

970
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,945
So how do I go from
what I have to that.

971
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:24,700
Yes, I know each
application is different,

972
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,515
but in general,

973
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:32,110
if they at least even
like starting some of

974
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,160
applications and even if

975
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,855
they're initially
toy applications

976
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,250
and you can grow from

977
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,140
there if you have
something that shows,

978
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,600
in this particular
area, in this field,

979
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,105
we have these tools

980
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:44,800
or knobs that you
can use to take

981
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,780
your standard even if

982
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,070
it's a toy application and

983
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,420
then you convert it
and then you can

984
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,850
compare and see
what's going on.

985
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,140
I think that'll
be a big help.

986
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,950
And regarding the question

987
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,270
of industry consortium.

988
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,280
It's a chicken
and egg problem

989
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,355
and I think Randy
also touched upon it.

990
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:05,340
And industry consortium
works great when if

991
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,660
you have industry already

992
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,310
working on something,

993
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,220
they already almost
have a product.

994
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,570
Somebody else
has a product?

995
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,220
Yes, how do we make
it work together?

996
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,695
Let's quickly come up
with a standard or

997
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,690
some way that

998
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,270
these inter-operate,
it's great.

999
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,970
But if you're trying
to come up with

1000
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,900
a standard it's easier
for industry to adopt,

1001
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,900
then it's a lot harder
to go the route

1002
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,375
of the industry consortium

1003
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:32,425
if that make sense.

1004
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:34,870
So just these
are things to

1005
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,930
keep in mind as we go
about this process.

1006
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:44,015
>> Thanks. Suzanne.

1007
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:47,310
>> Well, from my
vast experience with

1008
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,735
standard organizations

1009
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,805
and industry consortia,

1010
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,505
when you say an
industry consortia,

1011
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,500
I don't think
you're thinking

1012
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,010
of an industry
specifically,

1013
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,390
you are thinking of

1014
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,130
a horizontal
discussion of NDM.

1015
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,234
And that is different

1016
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:09,840
than what most people

1017
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,175
think of an
industry consortia.

1018
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,690
That's the kind
of consortia

1019
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,420
that Cisco would come into

1020
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,250
or Intel would
come into because

1021
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,250
they are horizontal
suppliers.

1022
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,205
But if what you're
thinking of

1023
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:26,145
is to provide
a place where

1024
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:30,360
let's say industrial
manufacturers like

1025
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,700
Honeywell or Siemens are

1026
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,410
looking at NDN and saying,

1027
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,769
could we use this for
our industrial systems?

1028
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,360
Because as we go to
more cloud-based,

1029
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,250
we're tracking
all this data

1030
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,140
and we're really only
interested in data.

1031
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,340
They would go looking

1032
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,810
for we're the
experts in NDN,

1033
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,100
we're all flocking and

1034
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,910
go there to try
and get answers,

1035
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,835
steal graduate students,

1036
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,050
that kind of thing so
that they could access

1037
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,484
existing expertise, get
questions answered,

1038
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,855
and get comfortable with

1039
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,880
the idea of adopting
something like

1040
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,220
that because it's a change

1041
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,085
and they're going
to be like well,

1042
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:21,600
has anybody
thought about X?

1043
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,070
Has anybody thought
about this?

1044
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,390
Has anybody thought
about that?

1045
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,430
And what if we're
doing this?

1046
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,960
So they're going
to be looking for

1047
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,985
some place to go to
get answers to that.

1048
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:31,740
And I don't know if right

1049
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,460
now there is a place
they could go.

1050
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,800
So that's one thing.

1051
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,670
If you develop that
kind of place,

1052
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,580
it would be nice to have
a relationship like

1053
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,365
a liaison relationship

1054
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:51,870
with something like IETF.

1055
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,615
Again, because
you're right, IETF,

1056
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:56,625
if you can say, well,

1057
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,800
IETF gave us
comments on this,

1058
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,210
then everybody is there's

1059
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,190
real people
involved in this,

1060
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,430
[LAUGHTER] it's not
just an academic idea.

1061
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,740
There are people
who are involved in

1062
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,325
real networking issues
and fundamental

1063
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:13,350
grappling with what
needs to be done

1064
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,300
to keep this vast
networking system

1065
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,370
moving involved
with this so

1066
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,770
we feel more comfortable.

1067
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,765
The other advantage,
of course,

1068
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:24,300
is that liaisons with

1069
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,265
standard organizations
give you

1070
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:28,110
access to other groups.

1071
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,180
For instance, you might
want to establish

1072
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,935
your liaison with the IIC,

1073
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,855
which is the
Cloud community,

1074
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,250
because they also would

1075
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,215
be interested in this.

1076
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:43,065
Just so that
they are aware

1077
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:46,485
of this is happening
and this is going on,

1078
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:48,090
I would say you're
not really talking

1079
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,970
about an industry
consortium

1080
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,695
so much as you're
talking about

1081
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,990
a subject matter
consortium.

1082
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,390
Also I will point
out SDOs are

1083
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,500
the only one
who can put out

1084
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,080
standards and generally
specifications,

1085
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,520
and there are
standards for who is

1086
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,709
this standard development
organization.

1087
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,550
>> [LAUGHTER]
Great. Thank you.

1088
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,770
>> If I could add
something now and

1089
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,500
inside I didn't listen
to your last comment,

1090
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,360
which is often
services are

1091
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,460
vertical for the
energy industry,

1092
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,510
and we're probably one of

1093
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,730
the few vertical
focus people that's

1094
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,340
crossing the horizontal
of this group.

1095
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,085
And so our customers

1096
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:34,260
could care less about
IETF standards.

1097
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,330
They care about
IEEE standards,

1098
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,630
NERC, CIP
regulations, IEC.

1099
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,590
So if it becomes
important to my people,

1100
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,870
they will become
IEEE standards

1101
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,400
for the cybersecurity

1102
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,375
of energy systems
using NDN like things.

1103
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,310
We're working with people
like that that are

1104
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,500
open to including
things like IEEE.

1105
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,580
[OVERLAPPING]

1106
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,420
>> Does NDN work
with IEC 62443?

1107
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,800
>> No, 61850.

1108
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,450
>> Oh, 61850.

1109
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,890
>> But we're actually
working on that.

1110
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,525
And so this is

1111
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:09,330
a meadow standards
problem where now we're

1112
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,940
talking about
two-dimensional things,

1113
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,565
and there's not
enough resources

1114
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,875
in this space yet to
address all of that,

1115
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,170
but we can start to
make some progress and

1116
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,005
help the horizontal
group that's doing

1117
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:23,310
the hard technical work

1118
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,260
understand the needs
of the vertical group

1119
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,880
which will be
less technical

1120
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,635
or application focused.

1121
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:31,240
So if that made sense.

1122
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,350
>> Great, thanks. I wanted

1123
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,330
to give a chance to
look over Kathy.

1124
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,445
I need to comment on
what's been said so far.

1125
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:45,250
Any comments
from you guys?

1126
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,670
>> I think those are
very valid perspective,

1127
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,235
the whole horizontal
versus vertical.

1128
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:54,630
And in some sense,

1129
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,995
especially for NDN,

1130
00:44:55,995 --> 00:44:59,040
if there are groups
that are looking

1131
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,130
at specific applications
or use cases,

1132
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,260
it may make more sense to

1133
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,545
look at those aspects
for a start small.

1134
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:10,080
But I still do believe
that there is a lot

1135
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,555
of benefit too,
in some sense,

1136
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:14,640
standardizing the
code, if you will,

1137
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,430
because a lot
of times, it's

1138
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,755
open to this version or
something like that.

1139
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:22,770
So if you have a way

1140
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,210
to download the code and

1141
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,205
try out your applications,

1142
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:28,800
that may be a
good place to go.

1143
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,245
While we are talking
on that discussion of

1144
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,060
the path to specification

1145
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,545
and standardization.

1146
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:36,195
And we can start small,

1147
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,590
it could be a couple of

1148
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,615
a few applications
or even,

1149
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,700
first we're looking at
the energy industry,

1150
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,600
or first we're looking at

1151
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,250
healthcare and
then we expand

1152
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,370
to other areas, wherever
there's interest.

1153
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,340
So those are all,

1154
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,410
I think, valid options.

1155
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,260
>> Luca, did you have
anything to add?

1156
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,325
>> Not much. I
think there are

1157
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:03,750
many good comments.

1158
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,490
Maybe one last
thing I would

1159
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:12,549
say is that as working
for the industry,

1160
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,620
you try, you go
standard when you

1161
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,865
really can do
it on your own.

1162
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:24,074
If there is something
you can do internally

1163
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,680
and it doesn't disrupt

1164
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,455
your business, you
don't need standards.

1165
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:33,060
And you may exploit

1166
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,335
existing standards
and you can

1167
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:37,335
change them as
long as you can.

1168
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:41,055
You have full control
of your system,

1169
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:42,900
including the system
you're using right

1170
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,330
now before doing meetings.

1171
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,845
It is not using

1172
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,605
standard RTP to
something different.

1173
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:51,030
But they own

1174
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,580
the entire applications
and they deploy it

1175
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,240
without any
interoperability

1176
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,190
with other partners.

1177
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,255
And that's okay for them.

1178
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:01,440
So their business continue

1179
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,245
to work without
any standards.

1180
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:07,530
Standard implies that
you have a community,

1181
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,380
you have multiple
actors that need

1182
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,590
to cooperate for the
sake of the business.

1183
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:20,370
>> Great. Thanks.
I wanted to

1184
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,030
bring up an example
that I'm familiar with,

1185
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,370
and I have to admit
my exposure and

1186
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,170
experience with
consortia and

1187
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,180
standards is very limited.

1188
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,620
But this is an
example that

1189
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,940
I thought was interesting,

1190
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,875
and this comes from
the automotive sector.

1191
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,780
And maybe that
would act as

1192
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,160
an inspiration for

1193
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,035
further thoughts
for this group

1194
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,330
and the example comes from

1195
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,280
an alliance called COVESA

1196
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,470
or the Connected
Vehicle Alliance.

1197
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,629
And they're working
together on developing

1198
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:52,185
VSS or the Vehicle
Signal Specification.

1199
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:54,360
So not a standard,
so specification.

1200
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,675
Now what this is,
is a naming scheme

1201
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,745
for all the signals

1202
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:01,725
that you can get
from a vehicle.

1203
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,300
So if you're familiar
with vehicles,

1204
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,710
there's a lot of
information that goes

1205
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,420
back and forth inside

1206
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,790
cars and the way
these things are

1207
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,415
transmitted is by signals.

1208
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:15,150
And these tend to be
very small data pieces,

1209
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,400
but they are,

1210
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,900
for example, the

1211
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,325
brake pedal has
been pressed

1212
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:24,435
or the headlights need
to go on and so forth.

1213
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,000
And all that
information is

1214
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,480
really useful once you
get it out of the car,

1215
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,830
put it in the Cloud,

1216
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,240
and then you
start developing

1217
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,965
applications on
top of those,

1218
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:36,630
for example the
insurance industry

1219
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,370
is extremely
interested in getting

1220
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,950
all that data because

1221
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,180
they want to offer models

1222
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,635
such as pay as
you drive or

1223
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,855
pay how you drive
and so forth.

1224
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,760
Now, what happened with

1225
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,730
these signals is
that every automaker

1226
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,190
came up with their
own way of naming

1227
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,190
them and
representing them,

1228
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,720
and the result of that

1229
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,550
is somebody was using
miles per hour,

1230
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,350
somebody was using
kilometers per hour,

1231
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,165
celsius, fahrenheit
and so forth.

1232
00:49:03,165 --> 00:49:04,650
It was a complete
mess when

1233
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,210
it came to trying
to correlate

1234
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,750
these data in
the Cloud and

1235
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,190
to give it to a customer

1236
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,930
like the insurance
agencies.

1237
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,600
What COVESA did is

1238
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,030
to sponsor an effort
to bring everybody

1239
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,150
together and
standardize the names

1240
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,325
for these signals with

1241
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:25,890
the goal of
everybody now has

1242
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,390
the same name and
now we can develop

1243
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,640
common applications
over these.

1244
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,240
They approached
W3C with the idea

1245
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,625
and found a group

1246
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,620
where everybody
was enthusiastic,

1247
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,640
everybody agreed
that there

1248
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,035
was a need for this.

1249
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:43,335
And they came up with
a representation,

1250
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,985
which by the way
is hierarchical,

1251
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,410
very NDN compatible.

1252
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,970
And they're
working on putting

1253
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,745
together the
specification and code

1254
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:55,570
to manipulate all the data

1255
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,790
that the specification
represents.

1256
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,110
Then moving forward, this

1257
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,550
seems to be successful,

1258
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,755
it seems to be a
success story,

1259
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,465
and a lot of
the automakers

1260
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:09,375
seem to be embracing
this effort.

1261
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,270
The reason for
mentioning this is I

1262
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,315
was wondering if
this is something,

1263
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:19,980
an example that
NDN could follow.

1264
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,440
I think the value
proposition for

1265
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,910
VSS is that everybody

1266
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,035
speaks the same language,

1267
00:50:25,035 --> 00:50:26,640
we can now build
applications.

1268
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,940
We have a broader value
proposition in NDN.

1269
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,980
We have to offer security,

1270
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,215
we can offer transport
and so forth.

1271
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:36,090
And therefore,
I think there's

1272
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,325
a good value
proposition there,

1273
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:39,450
although the
story's a little

1274
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,790
more complicated than VSS.

1275
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,050
Is that a model that can

1276
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:52,570
potentially work in the
case of NDN, Randy?

1277
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,800
>> Well, I think
based on what I've

1278
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,420
learned in the
last 40 minutes,

1279
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,865
I would say that's

1280
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:03,300
the follow-on of
adoption because

1281
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,500
now you said over there

1282
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,030
for multiple car companies

1283
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,440
using them in the

1284
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,270
standards or
specification,

1285
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,620
in this case,
would evolve.

1286
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,185
And so I don t
think we're there,

1287
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:15,480
I don't think we're
really close here.

1288
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,650
And when we're getting the

1289
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,685
first taste of that,

1290
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:21,090
in our case, I
think it will

1291
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,410
happen naturally when it's

1292
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,605
time now that I
think through this.

1293
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:29,850
So I think it

1294
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,290
would be an indicator
of success,

1295
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,210
but it's not a way
to cause success.

1296
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,850
That's bad news.
[LAUGHTER] That

1297
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,710
I think that's
the reality.

1298
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,615
>> Fair enough.

1299
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:46,540
Luka any thoughts
on this one?

1300
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,850
>> I perfectly agree with

1301
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:55,905
this last comment because

1302
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,090
the use case you

1303
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,395
mentioned is
essentially again,

1304
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:01,910
we have people,

1305
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,184
big industrial
partners that require

1306
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:08,945
that standard
effort to happen

1307
00:52:08,945 --> 00:52:11,180
to continue doing

1308
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,350
their own business
essentially.

1309
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:18,600
So unless you
have a proof of

1310
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,680
value in the end let's
take this example,

1311
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,425
in the end, can be
adopted in that industry.

1312
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:29,190
And then

1313
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,840
standardization will
come right after.

1314
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,740
You mentioned essentially

1315
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,000
a technical advantage

1316
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,400
that you see if
that matches

1317
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,940
also in adoption
from those people,

1318
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,180
then yes, you may end
up doing standards,

1319
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,830
but not the other way
round you need to

1320
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,705
do this first to

1321
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:53,115
get the adoption from them

1322
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:54,270
because essentially

1323
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,440
they adopted
the technology.

1324
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,690
It was everyone doing
different things,

1325
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,070
well the same
thing differently,

1326
00:52:59,070 --> 00:52:59,850
and then at some point,

1327
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,680
they decided that
standard was

1328
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,700
important. Not the
other way around.

1329
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,000
>> Thanks, sounds good.

1330
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,770
At the end, I will give

1331
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,895
you a chance to respond.

1332
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:17,460
>> Sure. I
personally actually,

1333
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,230
I've always believed
that especially

1334
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,700
the namespace
part mean it need

1335
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,335
not be the first team
to be standardized

1336
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,270
as Randy and
Luca have said.

1337
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,610
This is what I personally
always believed.

1338
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,960
But I wanted to
share a couple of

1339
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,750
interesting anecdotes
where in some of

1340
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,640
those commercialization
discussions it's

1341
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,200
actually come to a halt

1342
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,210
because you mean there's
no standard way of

1343
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,575
representing all of these

1344
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:41,670
are anion is named based,

1345
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,380
but you mean there's no,

1346
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,670
at least even if

1347
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,050
there are multiple
options, again,

1348
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,820
you use this naming scheme

1349
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,515
or use the other
naming scheme?

1350
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:50,910
Well, you mean
there's nothing I can

1351
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,920
do that it's actually

1352
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,090
come to a halt a couple of

1353
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,745
times when
people find out,

1354
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:58,650
you mean there's
nothing out there and

1355
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,480
you have to do everything
all by yourself.

1356
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,070
So just wanted to share
some perspectives.

1357
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,600
>> Thanks [inaudible].

1358
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,000
So I did say I
wanted the audience

1359
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,535
to contribute if
they wanted to,

1360
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:15,630
anybody from the audience

1361
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,980
here wants to
add something.

1362
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,120
>> Hi, this is
Jeff Flight.

1363
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,335
>> Go ahead.

1364
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:28,845
>> I have put some
comments in the chat,

1365
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:31,740
but I agreed standardizing

1366
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,390
it from end to
end is probably

1367
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,040
not necessary and maybe

1368
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,410
counterproductive
but there's a couple

1369
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:42,225
of areas that standards
are really required.

1370
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:45,329
One is in the
networking aspects.

1371
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:48,375
If you're going to
build devices and

1372
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:51,300
network infrastructure
that can

1373
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,090
operate with endian
directly and by the way,

1374
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,650
that network
infrastructure

1375
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,555
is increasingly
software-based,

1376
00:54:57,555 --> 00:55:02,084
Kubernetes as a CNI.

1377
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:03,720
And of course, with

1378
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,920
all the other
stuff going on

1379
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,810
in the networking world,

1380
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,090
you have to have
some degree

1381
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,110
of standardization

1382
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,400
because a high degree

1383
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,770
of interoperability
is required.

1384
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,605
Not a little bit
of it a lot.

1385
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,180
And you just can't
do that through

1386
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,330
bilateral
discussions and swap

1387
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,500
meets and stuff like that.

1388
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,000
I found that to

1389
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,660
be very problematic
in my career.

1390
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,890
The second area is

1391
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,880
with Application
Development.

1392
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,700
So endian presents
a new way

1393
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,440
that applications
can network

1394
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,120
and share data etc.

1395
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,585
So you need an
adaptation layer

1396
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:43,110
that's a bit
different than

1397
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,310
a file system or an

1398
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,005
object store or
something like that

1399
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,280
that can be interacted

1400
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,200
with by the applications.

1401
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,789
endian presents
an opportunity

1402
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:51,870
for the application to

1403
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,190
actually control
a lot more

1404
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,140
about their data
than they can today.

1405
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,615
So if you want developers,

1406
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,415
they've got to
have a target

1407
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:01,305
to develop against,

1408
00:56:01,305 --> 00:56:03,630
otherwise, it won't work.

1409
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,655
So those are
two areas where

1410
00:56:05,655 --> 00:56:08,670
a degree of stability

1411
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,950
and a high degree of

1412
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:15,540
specification in
my experience,

1413
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,490
would be very helpful
so that you can

1414
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,680
drive developer
adoption with

1415
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,040
an application
interface and you

1416
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,790
can dive networking
standardization.

1417
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,784
So if people
feel comfortable

1418
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:31,560
developing interfaces to

1419
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,060
endian and hosting

1420
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,990
endian capabilities
with their equipment.

1421
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,420
>> Can I say a little bit?

1422
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,120
Just from the point
of view of standards,

1423
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,250
interoperability is one of

1424
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,590
the oldest points to

1425
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,270
the standard to come

1426
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,530
up with something that you

1427
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,530
agree what something
is everywhere.

1428
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,090
That's why weights
and measures

1429
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,370
are some of the oldest
standards because

1430
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:59,700
you had to have agreement
on how much that

1431
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,525
was if you wanted
to trade in it.

1432
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:07,560
So if you're looking
at endian and there

1433
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,955
are things, I
guess I would say,

1434
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:13,260
what's that you have to

1435
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,515
have in ordering to get

1436
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:19,410
an endian-based
application to work with

1437
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,140
any other
endian-application or

1438
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,365
with non-endian
applications.

1439
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:30,645
That is something that
is an adoption problem

1440
00:57:30,645 --> 00:57:33,630
because customers
and I'm not

1441
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,690
talking about
Cisco or Intel,

1442
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,770
I'm talking
about the people

1443
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,440
Cisco's selling to
want to make sure that

1444
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,270
what they buy isn't

1445
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,650
a one-off because
they've gotten

1446
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,059
caught in that before

1447
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,160
where they've
bought stuff.

1448
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,185
In fact, the
industrial world is

1449
00:57:49,185 --> 00:57:51,630
littered with things
that they have

1450
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,950
bought that are not

1451
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,360
upgradable or

1452
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,370
interoperable with
anything else.

1453
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,620
And then they have to
buy all new layer stuff

1454
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,285
on top of that.

1455
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:05,880
They've become
shy of things.

1456
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,500
I also have to
point out in

1457
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,000
terms of your
consortium for the

1458
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,740
automotive in the
automotive industry,

1459
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,910
the communications within

1460
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,080
the vehicle are allegedly

1461
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,519
based on an unacknowledged

1462
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:18,930
standard called Canvas,

1463
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,745
which was developed
by Bosch.

1464
00:58:20,745 --> 00:58:22,125
And then Bosch said, hey,

1465
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,880
everybody can use it.

1466
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,890
And they all name it
differently because

1467
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,420
they never have to
talk to each other.

1468
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,195
[LAUGHTER] That's
how that wound up.

1469
00:58:32,195 --> 00:58:34,280
So I can see that

1470
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,080
the naming
convention might

1471
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,700
be an issue with
people saying, "Well,

1472
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,600
if I name everything

1473
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,950
myself and then I want to

1474
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,690
inter-operate with
somebody else

1475
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:42,410
and they've named

1476
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,580
all their stuff
differently,

1477
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,530
then do I have to
rename everything

1478
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,030
or is there a translator

1479
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,275
that it can run through?"

1480
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:52,715
So that is an area
of interoperability.

1481
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:54,800
The idea that you'll
be able to work within

1482
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,275
a larger universe
than just yourself,

1483
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:59,540
that could drive you

1484
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,135
to at least a
specification.

1485
00:59:02,135 --> 00:59:03,440
>> Yeah, it's interesting

1486
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,220
that you say that you're

1487
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,270
absolutely right about

1488
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,560
the automotive industry.

1489
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,270
They didn't
name everything

1490
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,235
the same way because
they didn't have to.

1491
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:12,155
>> Because they don't
like each other.

1492
00:59:12,155 --> 00:59:13,445
>> And they don't
like each other.

1493
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,035
>> Or insurance companies.

1494
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:16,970
>> So this was in
complete contrast

1495
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,515
with a tracking industry

1496
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:20,270
because they came up with

1497
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,120
the naming standard
DJ 1939 standard.

1498
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,890
And the reason for doing

1499
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,810
that is that in the
tracking world,

1500
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,360
you don't order a car from

1501
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,620
a single manufacturer and

1502
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,480
you get it complete.

1503
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,530
You say I want this,

1504
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,940
I what these, I want that.

1505
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,680
And then everybody
had to be able

1506
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,180
to talk to each
other because

1507
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,710
to obey the specification

1508
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,300
that you ordered,
the attracts us.

1509
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,630
A little bit of history
there in terms of

1510
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,485
them trying to
work together.

1511
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,480
>> I will say this will
also be a major issue

1512
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,925
with any heavily
regulated industries.

1513
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:59,240
>> Yeah. Talking about

1514
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,830
interoperability
and getting things

1515
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,675
to work with each other,

1516
01:00:05,675 --> 01:00:10,115
I always had this sense
that with the NDN,

1517
01:00:10,115 --> 01:00:15,140
could we come to
a point where

1518
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,990
all somebody has
to specify was

1519
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,180
the naming scheme and

1520
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,815
how things relate
to each other?

1521
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:23,930
So in other words, a lot

1522
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,730
of people mentioned
so far that it would

1523
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,810
be great if I could

1524
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,100
use this without having to

1525
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,295
write any code or
very little code.

1526
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,925
How easy it is to use
from the beginning,

1527
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:37,760
it's crucial and it's
a big factor in terms

1528
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,745
of me deciding
to adopt it.

1529
01:00:40,745 --> 01:00:42,410
Would it be possible

1530
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,700
within the end to come to

1531
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,230
a point where
somebody comes

1532
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,970
in with their
naming structure,

1533
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,500
the hierarchical
naming structure,

1534
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,530
and we can help
specify how that is.

1535
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,720
And then the relationships

1536
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,620
we talk about security,

1537
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,610
for example, tracks,

1538
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,110
schema, and and all that.

1539
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,895
Could we get to the point

1540
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:00,575
where somebody comes in

1541
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:02,090
with a naming
structure and

1542
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,340
the relationships
between the data,

1543
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,970
the content that
they want to adopt,

1544
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,470
and then import this into

1545
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,830
NDN and then they
release, you can use it?

1546
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,840
Or is this too much
of a pipe dream?

1547
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,315
>> So when you say

1548
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:21,920
import it and there
you can use it,

1549
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,410
are you talking about

1550
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,095
application development
or are you talking,

1551
01:01:27,095 --> 01:01:28,010
okay I just have

1552
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,360
the naming scheme
and now I can use

1553
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,440
that in the
application that

1554
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,330
I've already developed?

1555
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,550
>> Yes. You have a
naming scheme in

1556
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,080
the application that
you want to use,

1557
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,880
you import it to NDN
and now you have

1558
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,670
transport and
secure transport.

1559
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:46,140
I think Lisa has a lot
to say about this one.

1560
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,440
>> You want me to talk?

1561
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,355
So outrageous opinion.

1562
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:55,925
Take a big grain of salt
before you hear me.

1563
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:58,070
Look, we're getting into

1564
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,635
this award of
name the data.

1565
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:03,050
Think about the older days

1566
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:07,550
we still have this
award of I dress,

1567
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:11,060
identify the nodes with

1568
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,430
the Internet
still exist if

1569
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,179
everyone has their
own registries.

1570
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:20,280
So I think it's a similar

1571
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,495
analogy is the same thing.

1572
01:02:23,495 --> 01:02:26,000
One thing I learned
from Jeff Berg,

1573
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,410
I learned so many things

1574
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,675
from him over the years.

1575
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:35,675
Data is not bounded to
specific applications.

1576
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:39,244
Data will cross
application boundaries.

1577
01:02:39,244 --> 01:02:41,630
The trivial
example, you drag

1578
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,860
a picture out of your

1579
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,440
[inaudible] and you
drop into email.

1580
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,480
You incorporate that into

1581
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,070
your PDF files and

1582
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,210
no one who knows where it

1583
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,290
goes, things like that.

1584
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:56,180
So if we think of
the future world

1585
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,855
is everyone swaps
named the data,

1586
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:06,065
then you do have to have
a shared namespace.

1587
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:09,170
I think that's a
fundamental points.

1588
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,790
>> I will say that

1589
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,950
the Internet
naming schemes

1590
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,710
may not be the
best example,

1591
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,910
since that was owned by

1592
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:19,670
the US government
and just had

1593
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,590
a single owner impose
it on everybody and

1594
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,090
then eventually it got

1595
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,395
taken over by the world.

1596
01:03:24,395 --> 01:03:27,140
But the naming convention

1597
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,490
had already existed.

1598
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:32,160
So it was a little easier.

1599
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,860
>> For namespace,
this part,

1600
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,210
I realize that people

1601
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,115
have all the
different opinions.

1602
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,685
I think that's where
given a discussion,

1603
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,850
maybe we'll have
a yet another

1604
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,365
[inaudible] next year.

1605
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:48,305
And specifically have
a panel on maybe.

1606
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:49,850
In Panel 1,

1607
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,530
I think one of the topics

1608
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,510
we touched upon is naming.

1609
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:56,000
And you can remember

1610
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,775
the panelists have very
different opinions,

1611
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:01,235
so I will stop.

1612
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:03,215
Am not going to drop into

1613
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,155
that wormhole for now.

1614
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:08,090
But I just wanted
to point it

1615
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,130
out that, "Hey, guys.

1616
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:11,960
Look at the the
big picture,

1617
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,300
we're getting to
name the data."

1618
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,310
So you have to think about

1619
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,215
a shared namespace

1620
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:21,540
so that there's
interoperability.

1621
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,800
>> Great. Harman,
you had a comment?

1622
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,920
>> Yeah. Just a quick
comment and a question.

1623
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,080
So I'm less worried
about the naming,

1624
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,520
but more worried
about the features

1625
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,125
and functionalities
because

1626
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:36,410
each industry have
different needs.

1627
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,185
The health
industry, they need

1628
01:04:39,185 --> 01:04:40,580
different features
compared to

1629
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,950
the automotive
industry, for example.

1630
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:45,620
Energy industry,
same thing.

1631
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,800
So I liked the
discussion about

1632
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,320
vertical standards

1633
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,870
versus horizontal,
for example.

1634
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,110
So the mainstream
will be horizontal,

1635
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:00,050
but industries needs
vertical centralization,

1636
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,030
which means different
specification,

1637
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,035
different features.

1638
01:05:03,035 --> 01:05:05,735
I can't just take
the general NDN

1639
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,320
and just put it in

1640
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,550
a car and expect
it to work.

1641
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,830
No, it's not going to
work. For example,

1642
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,330
does not support
automotive

1643
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,500
specific features.

1644
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,230
How does it communicate

1645
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,585
with other communication
standards?

1646
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:16,985
It was like

1647
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:18,575
the can communication
we talked about.

1648
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:19,880
There is flex rate, there

1649
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,230
is Linn, there's ethernet.

1650
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,660
So there's a bunch
of other standards

1651
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,300
that needs to be
supported as well.

1652
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,200
That's at least from

1653
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,565
an automotive standpoint.

1654
01:05:28,565 --> 01:05:32,405
There is time sink,
there is diagnostics.

1655
01:05:32,405 --> 01:05:33,950
It's going to be a can of

1656
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,555
worms, but it's not.

1657
01:05:35,555 --> 01:05:38,240
It has been done so
many times with other,

1658
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,520
I would say, contenders,
I would say.

1659
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,920
So NDN really brings

1660
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,100
networking and
security in one place.

1661
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:52,190
But the question
is, what resources

1662
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,440
are available for
the standardization?

1663
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,440
Because it's a huge topic
and standardizing a

1664
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,880
horizontal, it's
extremely difficult.

1665
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,850
So my opinion, starting
with the verticals,

1666
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,400
like small industries or

1667
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,325
different specification
for each industry,

1668
01:06:10,325 --> 01:06:12,320
for example, I think
that's the step

1669
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,300
towards global or
horizontal standardization.

1670
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,015
>> If I add onto that.

1671
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,160
First of all, I understand

1672
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,770
your concern about
the horizontal,

1673
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,300
but I want to add,

1674
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,690
however, horizontal
is based on

1675
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:35,225
today's model of
how system works.

1676
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:37,820
We already run into
problems with this,

1677
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,615
for example, cases,
Internet drafts.

1678
01:06:41,615 --> 01:06:44,675
I think she tried
to transport first

1679
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:45,920
and transporters we

1680
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,750
don't care about security.

1681
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:52,475
So today's I hate to
make too many enemies.

1682
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,870
But today's like the
IETF areas structure,

1683
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:02,645
totally based on the
old modeling of areas.

1684
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:05,030
So transport cares about

1685
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,520
congestion
control and seems

1686
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,065
like don't kill me.

1687
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:11,090
Congestion control only,

1688
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,535
security, not
part of that.

1689
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,724
Because we have this model

1690
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:17,240
of a security is really

1691
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,855
outside of
[inaudible] area,

1692
01:07:20,855 --> 01:07:23,960
transported area, or
your application area.

1693
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,260
There's an add-on. But at

1694
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,915
the end fundamentally
change in that.

1695
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:32,870
In the inside,
security is a part of

1696
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:36,950
the basic gene as
a design the end.

1697
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:37,940
So therefore,

1698
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,470
our security
shouldn't be really

1699
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,935
a totally separate
area per se.

1700
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,290
But security must be

1701
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,815
a ingredient, all
the components.

1702
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,255
So maybe in that sense,

1703
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:53,225
I would support your
things so-called heart.

1704
01:07:53,225 --> 01:07:54,710
Where do you go? But it's

1705
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,210
not really what they go.

1706
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:59,900
Essentially, as a new
architecture model,

1707
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,600
and really asking for

1708
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,750
different ways
to partition

1709
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,670
the functional modules,

1710
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:11,330
that's different from
what I have [inaudible].

1711
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:12,665
>> I'll just clarify.

1712
01:08:12,665 --> 01:08:16,685
Horizontal standards
exist outside security.

1713
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:20,390
Basically, a
horizontal standard is

1714
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,910
a general statement of

1715
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,250
best practices for
whatever it is.

1716
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,490
There are horizontal
standards in safety,

1717
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,889
there are horizontal
standards in security,

1718
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,050
there are horizontal
standards

1719
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,045
in other areas.

1720
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:38,765
And then the vertical
standard says,

1721
01:08:38,765 --> 01:08:45,755
within this particular
industry or usage,

1722
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,630
this is how we are taking

1723
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,115
that horizontal
standard and

1724
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:51,290
making it
particular to us.

1725
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:54,080
So 62443,

1726
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,820
I'm going back to
the security space,

1727
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,510
but this is true.

1728
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,010
The safety stays too,

1729
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,790
62443 is a
horizontal standard.

1730
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,010
It is applicable to

1731
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,025
any industrial automation.

1732
01:09:07,025 --> 01:09:11,510
AGA, the American
Gas Association has

1733
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,160
a whole series of

1734
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,095
security standards that
are based on 62443,

1735
01:09:18,095 --> 01:09:19,970
but then talk in detail

1736
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:21,380
about what's
necessary for,

1737
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,320
say, pipeline or
refineries, cyber security.

1738
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,090
And they've done the
exact same thing

1739
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,010
with the safety standards.

1740
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:32,270
So a horizontal
standard is meant to

1741
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:36,170
give the broadest
possible,

1742
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,820
highest possible set of

1743
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,580
best practices
and requirements,

1744
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,010
which then in

1745
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,635
vertical standards
can be specified.

1746
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:48,350
So I just wanted to say
that there's actually

1747
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,430
a formal definition of

1748
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,080
a horizontal standard
verse a vertical.

1749
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,190
>> Great. So I wanted
to move to the

1750
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,355
last question for today,

1751
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:00,780
and I wanted to make sure

1752
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,370
we have some time
to cover this.

1753
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:07,410
So this has to do with
how to make impacts.

1754
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,285
And so it goes a
little broader than

1755
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:11,475
standards or specifications
and so forth.

1756
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:13,770
But I wanted to get
thoughts from the panel

1757
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:17,115
about ways to make
impact with NDN.

1758
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,370
And when we
started with NDN,

1759
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,150
it was part of

1760
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,160
the future internet
architectures project.

1761
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,020
It was a project
at the NSF

1762
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,355
that essentially
challenged

1763
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,380
researchers with coming up

1764
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,630
with the next version
of the Internet.

1765
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:35,565
So it was a very
big change.

1766
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,355
They essentially
challenged us with,

1767
01:10:38,355 --> 01:10:40,470
you're complaining
about Internet

1768
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,235
all this time,

1769
01:10:41,235 --> 01:10:42,990
tell us, if you
were to design

1770
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,420
the Internet today,
how would you do it?

1771
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:49,500
However, making
impact doesn't

1772
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,790
necessarily mean that you

1773
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,155
have to be at that scale.

1774
01:10:52,155 --> 01:10:55,320
You can make impact
in many other ways.

1775
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,775
For example, you can make

1776
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:58,020
a small change
that affects

1777
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,220
a large group
or you can make

1778
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,350
a big change that
affects a small group.

1779
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,585
And I wonder if

1780
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,350
we need to start
looking at other ways

1781
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,435
of making impact beyond

1782
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:13,575
perhaps the original
task of NDN.

1783
01:11:13,575 --> 01:11:16,275
Randy, I think you
have some thoughts.

1784
01:11:16,275 --> 01:11:18,015
You have some
work on that one?

1785
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,620
>> Well, [NOISE] I like

1786
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,880
it because it allows me to

1787
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,760
reiterate my
basic point here,

1788
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,085
which is that we really

1789
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:28,770
at Opera only care
about the bottom lin.

1790
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,900
We want to affect
a small group,

1791
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,850
and the small
group is literally

1792
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,380
the few customers
that will buy

1793
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,105
our product in
the next year.

1794
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:38,700
Like we just need to
influence a few people.

1795
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,260
The next stage
of our company

1796
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,210
requires a couple
of more customers,

1797
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,250
the size of the
constellation people.

1798
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,690
We just need to convince

1799
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,195
them and the rest of
this will follow.

1800
01:11:48,195 --> 01:11:50,790
So that's the big change

1801
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,665
to the small
people I think.

1802
01:11:52,665 --> 01:11:55,380
And we're really close

1803
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,120
because we can
totally engage with

1804
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,445
visionary early
adopters inside

1805
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,050
significant corporations.

1806
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,040
We can get in
front of them.

1807
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,125
They like the message.

1808
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,630
We need the material
that I call

1809
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,460
the internal sales
tools to get to

1810
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,695
the pragmatists
within the company.

1811
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:12,870
And so that has a lot of

1812
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,220
similarities to
the things that it

1813
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,990
takes to build a
specification,

1814
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,325
as I pointed out, but

1815
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:18,870
we need them for a
different purpose,

1816
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:21,675
which is a
predecessor step.

1817
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:25,170
And my product VP

1818
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,100
told me another line

1819
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,060
I wanted to put out there,

1820
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,190
which is customers
buy benefits.

1821
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,850
I think Lucas said that.

1822
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,260
Technologists talk
about elegance

1823
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,775
and future dreams,

1824
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:37,490
and up until the stage
right now we're really

1825
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,020
good at selling
future dreams

1826
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,220
of customer benefits.

1827
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,975
We've made that
much progress.

1828
01:12:41,975 --> 01:12:43,850
So we can tell
them what it's

1829
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,225
going to do for
them someday,

1830
01:12:46,225 --> 01:12:47,340
but we need to get to

1831
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,570
the thing where
we can say,

1832
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:50,565
what will it do
for you today?

1833
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:52,260
And we're not
quite there yet.

1834
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,005
So that's how all this
work could help us.

1835
01:12:55,005 --> 01:13:00,480
>> Great. So
looking at the end,

1836
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,490
I guess you guys
are coming from a

1837
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:05,520
bigger, large
company perspective.

1838
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,980
So I wanted to
see what you

1839
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,440
think about this idea.

1840
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,140
[inaudible], did
want to go first?

1841
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,850
>> Yeah, thanks.

1842
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,790
I agree. We
started out with,

1843
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,280
yes, a new Internet,
a big change.

1844
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,640
And I think that's going
to be a lot harder,

1845
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,620
not even realistic
in some sense.

1846
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,525
So then the
question becomes,

1847
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:32,790
how do you make

1848
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,290
those improvements or

1849
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,300
changes in specific areas

1850
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,580
and agree with
where Randy said in

1851
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,670
general is identify
those applications,

1852
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,890
where really NDN can make

1853
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,295
a big benefit and
go after those?

1854
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:49,320
And then work with

1855
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,720
the Internet that
we have today,

1856
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,170
making it better
rather than replacing.

1857
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,640
And in fact, when

1858
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,005
I started working
in this area,

1859
01:13:58,005 --> 01:14:00,570
I would preface
all my slides.

1860
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,800
Initially we're
saying, no,

1861
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,140
we are not trying
to replace IP.

1862
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,240
We're not trying to
change the Internet,

1863
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,070
because a lot of times
you could be like,

1864
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:09,150
now you're going to say,

1865
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,050
we're going to
change everything,

1866
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,130
I don't even
want to listen,

1867
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,620
and people would shut
down immediately.

1868
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,310
So right now even when
I talk, by the way,

1869
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:20,910
I don't even use
IP versus NDN,

1870
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,610
it's more existing
networks,

1871
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,840
or existing technologies,

1872
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,155
existing application
versus doing it.

1873
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:30,850
You're implementing
those with NDN.

1874
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,360
And I think that's where

1875
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,680
the discussion needs
to be in terms

1876
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,425
of adoption and actually

1877
01:14:39,425 --> 01:14:40,550
seeing light of day in

1878
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,725
terms of
commercialization.

1879
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:46,605
So here in this area

1880
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:49,355
or in this particular
computing application

1881
01:14:49,355 --> 01:14:52,170
in this, and I'm just
throwing things out there.

1882
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,630
[inaudible]
environment, yes,

1883
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,860
we see a lot of benefits.

1884
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,170
Let's make that real.
How do we do it?

1885
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,525
Whether does it needs
some standardization?

1886
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:01,590
But I think the
first step is

1887
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,835
just identifying

1888
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:06,210
where these big changes

1889
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,870
are and then we can
go after those.

1890
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,645
>> So [inaudible],
I'm curious,

1891
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:15,000
would you say you
have success when

1892
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,160
you're talking to
customers in this,

1893
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,390
I guess, more limited?

1894
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,380
>> That's a very
good question and

1895
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,550
a tough question
to answer.

1896
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:28,980
Yes and no. And it
has been a journey.

1897
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,930
Initially when
we started out,

1898
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,940
we were exploring
the entire area.

1899
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,950
And that's when
we realized

1900
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,840
when we're talking
about content,

1901
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,130
delivery people
didn't even

1902
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,210
want to hear because yes,

1903
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:41,850
we have CDNs, why
do we need this?

1904
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,290
And especially,
that applied

1905
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,850
when data was moving

1906
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,320
from the core of
the network to

1907
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,450
the edge of the
network like Netflix.

1908
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:51,405
But then as
applications evolved,

1909
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:54,840
there are situations
where data is generated

1910
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,250
at the edge of
the network and

1911
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,140
used at the edge
of the network,

1912
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,090
and there's a
lot of mobility

1913
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:03,870
and lack of stability

1914
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:05,745
of the networks,
if you will.

1915
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:08,430
Our mesh networking
where tracking

1916
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,180
down your addresses
becomes a lot harder,

1917
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,985
but people do see
the value there.

1918
01:16:14,985 --> 01:16:18,000
And another area where
people see values,

1919
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,399
like if you even
look at Kubernetes,

1920
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:22,140
all the resources have to

1921
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,655
be in the control
of one domain,

1922
01:16:23,655 --> 01:16:25,155
and that's how
Kubernetes operate,

1923
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:26,520
which is great for
the Cloud or for

1924
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,185
the most data
centers everywhere.

1925
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:29,520
But if you're looking at

1926
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,790
this far edge where

1927
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,700
you're talking about
client devices, cars,

1928
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,010
laptops, cell
phones, and if you

1929
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,335
want to pull together
these resources,

1930
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:41,850
they will all
never agree to be

1931
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:43,770
owned or controlled
by one entity.

1932
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:50,970
So how do you do that?
People saw that,

1933
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,770
yes, it's useful,
then that's

1934
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,900
where the question of
adoption also becomes.

1935
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,250
Then the question
becomes, okay,

1936
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,810
how much gain
am I getting,

1937
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,045
and how much do I
have to change?

1938
01:17:00,045 --> 01:17:02,700
And that's where the
discussion gets tricky.

1939
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:07,380
And this is where the
inertia also kicks in.

1940
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,630
How can I make

1941
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,490
some change to an
existing code?

1942
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,635
Yes, I don't get the
perfect solution,

1943
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:15,120
but can I live with
it at least for

1944
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,260
the next five years before

1945
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,030
things really break?

1946
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,785
It's the same question

1947
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:21,825
that Randy also
brought up is,

1948
01:17:21,825 --> 01:17:23,475
how can it solved
my problem

1949
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:25,620
like tomorrow
or this year?

1950
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,520
So yes, I think
to some extent,

1951
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,460
yes, we've seen success,

1952
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:35,310
but then the adoptability,

1953
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,860
ease of writing
applications,

1954
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,180
all of that also come in.

1955
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,070
But I think overall,
and I'm making this as

1956
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,530
a general statement
from what I've

1957
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:44,820
seen like even like from

1958
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,635
a lot of the RFPs
that come out,

1959
01:17:46,635 --> 01:17:48,870
I think the
defense segment is

1960
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,690
a lot more open to NDN.

1961
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:54,510
And I'm saying this in
a very broad manner,

1962
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:57,660
just looking at RFPs

1963
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,460
that have come out
from DARPA and so on,

1964
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,215
and not based on any

1965
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,075
scientific
research per se.

1966
01:18:03,075 --> 01:18:06,570
So that's my take on it.

1967
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:09,510
>> Great. Thanks. So Luca,

1968
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:10,830
I was wondering what
your thoughts are,

1969
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,670
how do you see NBN,

1970
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,215
trying to move
into this more,

1971
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:20,030
I think the term
that I heard

1972
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,770
was limited
network domains?

1973
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,360
And if you have

1974
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,100
talked to any of your
customers and if you

1975
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,290
had any success in

1976
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:30,510
terms of NBN going
in that direction.

1977
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,740
>> So in my personal
experience,

1978
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:37,455
we moved into HACN,

1979
01:18:37,455 --> 01:18:39,810
which is essentially using

1980
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,160
a different namespace,

1981
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,215
but all the machinery
is similar.

1982
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:45,960
That doesn't change
the experience.

1983
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,210
And we moved into

1984
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,595
something we
control completely,

1985
01:18:50,595 --> 01:18:52,335
which is online meetings

1986
01:18:52,335 --> 01:18:55,110
because it's a segment
that Cisco owns,

1987
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,880
WebEx for instance, and

1988
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,665
WebRTC and these things.

1989
01:18:58,665 --> 01:19:03,555
So that was easier, but

1990
01:19:03,555 --> 01:19:05,820
the community doesn't care

1991
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,205
about NDN or ICN
or whatever.

1992
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:10,020
Essentially
because you have

1993
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,385
to talk with
product manager,

1994
01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:14,070
you have to talk
people who have to

1995
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,210
invest money to insert

1996
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,085
the feature in
running product.

1997
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:21,060
And the motivation is
always revenue driven,

1998
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,970
which is if the
business is growing,

1999
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,560
is not really about cost,

2000
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,720
is more about
application quality.

2001
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,830
Essentially, if I get

2002
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,585
this picture
in my product,

2003
01:19:30,585 --> 01:19:33,540
is my application product

2004
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,345
in service better
than the competition?

2005
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:38,370
So you need to answer
that question.

2006
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:42,074
If your business is
stagnating or decreasing,

2007
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,680
then you can
focus on cost.

2008
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,080
And so you're going
to need to answer

2009
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,795
the question how much

2010
01:19:48,795 --> 01:19:51,705
can I save from my
operational costs?

2011
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:53,010
For instance, in the case

2012
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,600
of WebEx Cloud costs.

2013
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,850
And so during the
last few years,

2014
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:58,365
we've seen both
growing and

2015
01:19:58,365 --> 01:19:59,970
stagnation and then for

2016
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,740
COVID and then decreasing.

2017
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,645
And so we had to answer
all those questions.

2018
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:05,550
And so you need to have

2019
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,560
a way to answer
this questions.

2020
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:11,910
How much can I say
from Cloud cost?

2021
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:16,410
Or how better my video

2022
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:21,225
or audio or general
this application?

2023
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:22,530
How better with

2024
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,970
respect to Zoom,
I'm going to be?

2025
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,085
And how many more
customers can

2026
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:29,145
get if I use
your technology?

2027
01:20:29,145 --> 01:20:30,600
And so you need to
be able to measure

2028
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,970
that one way or the other.

2029
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,680
So AB testing was

2030
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,320
our approach to have

2031
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,500
measurable answers
to those questions.

2032
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,420
And this is a very
limited domain,

2033
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,470
because essentially
we don't have

2034
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,945
to interoperate
with anybody.

2035
01:20:45,945 --> 01:20:49,140
It's our application, our

2036
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,600
infrastructure that we can

2037
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,660
deploy all software
and [inaudible].

2038
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:58,560
So we don't need
any standard.

2039
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,540
We just need to
essentially to

2040
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,285
bind to it as a
business unit.

2041
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:05,040
So that's an opportunity.

2042
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,170
But as also Rainey
was saying,

2043
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,895
you need to make your
customers happy,

2044
01:21:08,895 --> 01:21:10,860
because at the
end of the day

2045
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,945
this is your
revenue stream

2046
01:21:12,945 --> 01:21:15,460
that is going to fund
everything else.

2047
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,550
And so I don't have

2048
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,705
the solution
for everything,

2049
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:20,070
but as long as you have

2050
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:22,740
a good answer for
your customers and

2051
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:27,300
they are buying into
it, follow the road.

2052
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,100
Because it means if

2053
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,615
they're ready
to pay for it,

2054
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:31,785
that's enough,

2055
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:33,730
you don't need
more than that.

2056
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,645
>> Great. Thanks
Luca. So we've got

2057
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,360
just about five or
six minutes left.

2058
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,100
And I did want

2059
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:48,310
to give an opportunity
to the panelists.

2060
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,390
So given that most

2061
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,025
of us here are
in academia.

2062
01:21:53,025 --> 01:21:54,870
If there's something
you wanted

2063
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,655
to say to us academics,

2064
01:21:56,655 --> 01:21:58,200
what would it be?

2065
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,710
And since we had
Luca talking,

2066
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,960
I think I want to
continue with him.

2067
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,170
So Luca, here's all
the academics here.

2068
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,625
Is there some advice?

2069
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:09,660
Is there something
you want to

2070
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:17,190
tell us about NDN?

2071
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,260
>> Well, I think that
academia should focus

2072
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,930
on solving our problems.

2073
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,675
The industry doesn't
have time to focus on,

2074
01:22:24,675 --> 01:22:27,265
because the industry
has to focus on,

2075
01:22:27,265 --> 01:22:30,470
again, make your
customers happy.

2076
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:32,315
And so in some
cases you need to

2077
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,850
fix things in quicker
dirty manner so

2078
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,500
that it works as long

2079
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,510
as the revenue continues

2080
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:43,155
to get in and that's it.

2081
01:22:43,155 --> 01:22:45,480
But the academia should be

2082
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,620
there not to write

2083
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,495
a codebase that is
used in the industry.

2084
01:22:48,495 --> 01:22:54,585
The mission of
the academia

2085
01:22:54,585 --> 01:22:57,260
is to solve our
problems and I

2086
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,730
think there are many in

2087
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,980
general in this domain.

2088
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:03,320
And then if
there is again,

2089
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,185
the industry that is
making profit out

2090
01:23:06,185 --> 01:23:09,560
of components of
this technology,

2091
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,385
then this is going to

2092
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:13,920
flow back to the
academia because

2093
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,690
the industry will
need the academia

2094
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,090
to work and to think about

2095
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:20,715
longer term problems
that are hard

2096
01:23:20,715 --> 01:23:22,410
and that the industry

2097
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:24,670
has no time to focus on.

2098
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:27,720
But the data
examples like in

2099
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,680
the Linux Foundation where

2100
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,630
you get a lot of people,

2101
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:34,140
100% funded by the
industry where they sit

2102
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,930
together, they
fix problems,

2103
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,510
which are
essentially around

2104
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,730
codebases which

2105
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,575
going into their
own products.

2106
01:23:43,575 --> 01:23:46,620
There's nothing to do
with academia and so I

2107
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,740
think it's fair to

2108
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:51,570
distinguish the
two things.

2109
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,330
The industry and academia

2110
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:57,070
is not the same codebase.

2111
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,560
>> Great, thank
you. So Kathyayani,

2112
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,340
given that academics
were probably most

2113
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,630
likely are not
going to write

2114
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,705
the code that
industry will use.

2115
01:24:09,705 --> 01:24:14,670
So what should we
be focusing on?

2116
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,230
How can we help

2117
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,115
you guys industry
promote NDN better?

2118
01:24:20,115 --> 01:24:21,720
>> That's a great question

2119
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,385
and thanks for
asking that.

2120
01:24:23,385 --> 01:24:26,910
One of the ways I think
as I brought it out

2121
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:29,190
is identifying
where there are

2122
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,710
the really big
bang for NDN.

2123
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:33,660
And sometimes that's
a very hard problem

2124
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,995
because in general,

2125
01:24:34,995 --> 01:24:36,930
we say yes, it
provides security,

2126
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:39,555
it provides
caching, discovery,

2127
01:24:39,555 --> 01:24:42,120
provides all of these,
but where are we

2128
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,375
really seeing the
100x benefits?

2129
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:48,570
Where are those use cases,

2130
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,650
their applications?

2131
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:52,110
And it's bringing
those out to

2132
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:54,180
the forefront
and it doesn't

2133
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,340
have to be perfect
commercial code.

2134
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,770
But even
comparison, saying,

2135
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:00,780
there is this application,

2136
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,580
do it this way and look

2137
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,650
at how much easier it is.

2138
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:07,080
And it doesn't
always have to be

2139
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,820
quantified in

2140
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,889
the traditional manner
of performance.

2141
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:13,810
Even security saying, yes,

2142
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,150
and I'm just giving
examples here.

2143
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,770
Either these many lines

2144
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,000
of code versus
you can just

2145
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,790
do it with x number
of lines of code.

2146
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,680
Or it requires
this many hours

2147
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,895
of development
versus this,

2148
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:29,220
or even more
concrete saying,

2149
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:32,520
look how much easier
and quicker or faster,

2150
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,959
and how much
better performance

2151
01:25:33,959 --> 01:25:35,700
you get if you do it.

2152
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,200
And there's
really big ones.

2153
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,850
The general ones
we all know about.

2154
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,290
But identifying
in some sense

2155
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:42,075
the silver bullets that,

2156
01:25:42,075 --> 01:25:44,820
where is the really
huge impact?

2157
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,930
And that could
be a big help.

2158
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,995
>> Great. So
what I'm hearing

2159
01:25:49,995 --> 01:25:52,770
is quantifying
the advantages.

2160
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,440
Give us something
to [OVERLAPPING].

2161
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,390
>> All sensor silver
bullets where

2162
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,820
it's really the advantage
it's huge here,

2163
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,020
because in general, yes,

2164
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,435
we are all aware
of the benefits.

2165
01:26:03,435 --> 01:26:05,130
But obviously
it's not been

2166
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,785
enough to move
the industry.

2167
01:26:07,785 --> 01:26:11,370
But there are areas
where NDN can

2168
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:13,425
provide much
bigger benefits

2169
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:14,655
than other areas.

2170
01:26:14,655 --> 01:26:18,180
So pointing,
showing that out

2171
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,890
and bringing those
to light and telling

2172
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,855
the industry look
at these areas.

2173
01:26:21,855 --> 01:26:23,340
Focus on these
areas and you

2174
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,885
will see huge benefits.

2175
01:26:24,885 --> 01:26:27,990
That will be a big
value, in my opinion.

2176
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,720
Great. Thank you.
Randy. How can

2177
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,740
we make your life easier?

2178
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,500
>> I wanted to
make two points.

2179
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,320
I think one is, I've
worked in a bunch of

2180
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,760
different industry
sectors and

2181
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,715
research areas over
my long career now.

2182
01:26:44,715 --> 01:26:47,415
This is one of the most
open and accepting

2183
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:49,409
academic communities

2184
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:51,405
for industry
collaboration.

2185
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:53,070
Everybody wants to provide

2186
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,515
this question
you're asking.

2187
01:26:55,515 --> 01:26:58,170
And so keep it
up that's going

2188
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,735
to be important if we
make the next steps.

2189
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:02,895
So that's a good thing.

2190
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:04,500
I personally feel falling

2191
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,880
up on Kathy Annie's point

2192
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,490
is that mandated
cybersecurity is

2193
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:11,595
the opportunity
for NDN because

2194
01:27:11,595 --> 01:27:14,910
mandates don't
allow industries

2195
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:17,850
to measure benefits like
they have to do it.

2196
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:20,160
And so a utility has

2197
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,870
requirements
and accept they

2198
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:23,610
must meet these
requirements.

2199
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:25,950
Now, the question is,
how much will it cost?

2200
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:29,050
How good will it
be? That thing.

2201
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,725
And in our case,

2202
01:27:31,725 --> 01:27:33,780
the Department of
Energy has funded us in

2203
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,880
early years
largely to provide

2204
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,590
technology they
believe will

2205
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:38,850
be necessary to meet

2206
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,350
the mandated
requirements for

2207
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:42,735
security that will
come to the grid.

2208
01:27:42,735 --> 01:27:44,610
And so they see
the vision.

2209
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:46,965
They pay us to
get there first.

2210
01:27:46,965 --> 01:27:50,040
Academic partners are
super-important to

2211
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,380
that research program
because that's where we

2212
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,260
get our credibility in
our actual technology.

2213
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,770
And so continuing
to partner with

2214
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,275
industrial people who
are going to meet

2215
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:03,600
mandated cybersecurity

2216
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,965
things is your best bet.

2217
01:28:04,965 --> 01:28:09,765
So health, like
land's doing, pharma,

2218
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:13,875
energy, there's
maybe automotive

2219
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:17,025
or trucking like these
will be mandates.

2220
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,620
And so we had a
little luck in

2221
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,045
our last company
where we made

2222
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,250
solar measurement
technology equipment

2223
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,110
like test equipment and

2224
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,360
the government
required you measure

2225
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,460
the solar potential
of any site and

2226
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,480
so everybody had the buyer

2227
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,920
or equipment all
of a sudden.

2228
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,260
That could happen
here. We don't know.

2229
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:37,080
So that's my
encouragement.

2230
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,540
>> That sounds
great. Thank you.

2231
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,460
>> Suzanne,, you

2232
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,750
have the last
word of the day.

2233
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,470
>> Oh, my goodness.

2234
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,985
I have the last
word of the day.

2235
01:28:44,985 --> 01:28:48,885
I think there's two
levels of development.

2236
01:28:48,885 --> 01:28:50,790
There is the level
of development that

2237
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,995
takes place at
places like Cisco,

2238
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:55,050
Intel, Honeywell, etc,

2239
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:56,940
where they are
implementing

2240
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,750
it into the products.

2241
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,440
I think one of the most

2242
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,940
important things
from their point

2243
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,320
of view is that
their customers

2244
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,210
have no idea they did it.

2245
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:07,310
They don't want to explain

2246
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:09,530
this to the
grid operators.

2247
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:11,570
They don't want
to explain this

2248
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:14,555
to the chemical plants.

2249
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:18,200
The chemical plants
just want this to work.

2250
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,880
and if they then

2251
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,590
get all these
security benefits,

2252
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,210
that's great, but I am not

2253
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:26,805
retraining anybody
to do this.

2254
01:29:26,805 --> 01:29:28,140
I just want it to

2255
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,940
work and I want
to be able to buy

2256
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,800
things going on
that all work

2257
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,510
together and not have

2258
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:34,680
to deal with any of this.

2259
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,270
Because if I never
hear anything

2260
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,100
about NDN I will
be happy for

2261
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,260
the rest of my life
because they're

2262
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,605
operators and they
don't really care.

2263
01:29:43,605 --> 01:29:48,345
So I think that
it's helpful for

2264
01:29:48,345 --> 01:29:49,620
academics because they are

2265
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,370
willing to deal with

2266
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,935
all the things that
go on under the hood.

2267
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:57,330
So that when the grid
buys this from Cisco,

2268
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:58,935
whatever, they
don't have to care.

2269
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:00,270
Just like they don't

2270
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,340
currently care how
the Internet works.

2271
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,190
They really could
not care less.

2272
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:07,590
And most of the
time they have

2273
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,470
no idea and they
don't want to know.

2274
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,510
So I think that you
have to realize that

2275
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:14,670
NDN is the thing that

2276
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:16,650
no one is going to
care how it works as

2277
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,560
long as it works
completely invisibly.

2278
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,720
And if you get
to that point,

2279
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,100
they will all be
happy with it.

2280
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,090
>> Sounds great.
Thank you.

2281
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:30,135
That concludes the
panel for today.

2282
01:30:30,135 --> 01:30:32,490
Let's thank the
panelists. Thank you.

2283
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:34,230
[APPLAUSE] Luke
and Kathy Annie,

2284
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:36,540
thank you so much
for participating.

2285
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,370
Luke, special
thanks to you for

2286
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,860
staying up late. We
appreciate this.

2287
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,700
>> Thank you.

2288
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,970
>> Thank you.

2289
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:47,685
>> Welcome back, everyone.

2290
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:50,490
Agenda now is
session number

2291
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:53,880
five on applications
and services,

2292
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,810
and will be chaired by
Demetrius from MITER.

2293
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:00,105
Demetrius is
head of R&D of

2294
01:31:00,105 --> 01:31:01,950
infrastructure
networking division at

2295
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,270
MITER and has been

2296
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,490
involved with NDN for
a number of years.

2297
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:08,260
So Dima, go ahead, please.

2298
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,260
>> Thank you. So
we're about to

2299
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,705
start for everyone
in the back.

2300
01:31:15,705 --> 01:31:18,255
So for this session,

2301
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:20,130
we have one demo and

2302
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,840
we have four
presentations.

2303
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,105
We will kick it
off with a demo.

2304
01:31:24,105 --> 01:31:25,605
mGuard is secure

2305
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,600
mHealth data-sharing
infrastructure

2306
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,320
over NDN from
Suravi Regmi.

2307
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,730
He's a PhD student and

2308
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:33,600
research assistant at

2309
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,590
the University of Memphis,

2310
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,495
working with Dr. Lan Wang.

2311
01:31:36,495 --> 01:31:39,940
And she'll have
a video to play.

2312
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,910
>> Thank you.
Hello everybody.

2313
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,545
My name is Suravi Regmi.

2314
01:31:46,545 --> 01:31:49,770
And I will be doing
a demo on mGuard

2315
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:51,180
secure mHealth data

2316
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,970
sharing infrastructure
over NDN.

2317
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:56,310
So this slide might

2318
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,200
look a bit familiar
because we've been

2319
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,195
through this
yesterday as well so

2320
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:02,850
the presentation
started barons.

2321
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,805
So I'll try and keep
this very short.

2322
01:32:05,805 --> 01:32:08,040
mGuard is designed
to achieve

2323
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,710
fine-grain contextual
access control using

2324
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:14,175
user-defined access
control policies.

2325
01:32:14,175 --> 01:32:17,100
And it provides real-time
data delivery using

2326
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,080
high-level Pub-Sub API

2327
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,570
and supports
high-frequency data.

2328
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:24,150
So the goal of this
presentation is

2329
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:26,625
to demonstrate the
overall system,

2330
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:29,130
especially the access
control policies

2331
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:31,455
and the Pub-Sub API.

2332
01:32:31,455 --> 01:32:33,540
So let's get into

2333
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,760
the access
control policies.

2334
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,340
It is designed to
limit data access to

2335
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:40,740
only authorized
users based

2336
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,530
on terms of use
and privacy risks.

2337
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:45,675
And it is defined
by the data owner.

2338
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:47,310
So our policy description

2339
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,050
looks pretty
simple because we

2340
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,870
want users who are
not technically

2341
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,340
inclined to be
able to write

2342
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,275
their own policy
descriptions.

2343
01:32:55,275 --> 01:32:57,570
So we've got
requestor names.

2344
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,820
It can be one person,
multiple people,

2345
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:02,520
a team of people, and
attribute filters.

2346
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,900
We can have
multiple attribute

2347
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,910
filters as well.

2348
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:08,340
We are using policy A, B,

2349
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:09,825
and C. These are
the policies that

2350
01:33:09,825 --> 01:33:12,270
we are using in the
demonstration as well.

2351
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,980
The first policy we've

2352
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:17,070
got requests for data
requests to Alice.

2353
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:19,020
And they have the
attribute filter

2354
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,160
where we allow them to

2355
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,485
access all the streams

2356
01:33:22,485 --> 01:33:25,080
under the prefix org md2k.

2357
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,590
For policy B, we've
got requester Bob.

2358
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:30,360
We allow them to access

2359
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,120
everything with
prefix org md2k,

2360
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,970
but we deny them the
GPS stream of data.

2361
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,410
And for policy C,

2362
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,720
we've got user Saurab.

2363
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:43,320
We allow them the semantic
locations stream.

2364
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,240
But we've got
another thing right

2365
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,520
there that says
attributes location home,

2366
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,935
which basically means
that Saurab can access

2367
01:33:49,935 --> 01:33:52,290
all semantic
location data if

2368
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:56,200
they're generated
in location home.

2369
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,250
Next, we use policy parser

2370
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,260
to parse the access
control policies,

2371
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,045
to create ABE policy,

2372
01:34:03,045 --> 01:34:05,175
which we will use to

2373
01:34:05,175 --> 01:34:07,410
obtain the decryption key.

2374
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:09,030
So you can see
in the example,

2375
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:10,965
we've got our policy,

2376
01:34:10,965 --> 01:34:12,420
which is a bit
simpler than

2377
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:15,840
the ABE policy which
explains it a lot more.

2378
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,350
The current status
of our project is

2379
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,640
that we've implemented

2380
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,365
all the modules in C++.

2381
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,730
Feel free to go through

2382
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,935
the source code
installation guide.

2383
01:34:25,935 --> 01:34:27,120
Let us know what
we're doing

2384
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,535
wrong or you
can help with.

2385
01:34:29,535 --> 01:34:31,755
So for the demo setup,

2386
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:34,680
we've got mGuard server

2387
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,270
that's running producer,

2388
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,235
controller, and
repository,

2389
01:34:38,235 --> 01:34:40,875
which is connected
to the Memphis node.

2390
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,420
All three of these
applications

2391
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,290
can be run separately,

2392
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:45,720
but for the demo purposes,

2393
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,345
we've run this in
the same server.

2394
01:34:48,345 --> 01:34:50,895
We've got three
different consumers with

2395
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:51,930
distinct policies

2396
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:53,550
running in three
different nodes.

2397
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:55,800
And the controller
is configured

2398
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,829
with all the access
control policies.

2399
01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:01,590
We've got three
data streams,

2400
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:03,585
the semantic location
data stream,

2401
01:35:03,585 --> 01:35:04,950
the battery data stream,

2402
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,615
and the GPS data stream.

2403
01:35:06,615 --> 01:35:08,280
And for the data
generation,

2404
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,485
we've used 120 data
points per minute.

2405
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:12,360
We could have
got to bigger,

2406
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,680
but for demonstration
purpose,

2407
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,515
we wanted you to
visualize that data.

2408
01:35:16,515 --> 01:35:18,855
And policies, as I
mentioned already.

2409
01:35:18,855 --> 01:35:20,790
We've got three
different policies

2410
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:23,170
for three different users.

2411
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:27,725
So this is the topology
that we're using.

2412
01:35:27,725 --> 01:35:30,320
We can see that
the mGuard server

2413
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,690
is connected to
the Memphis node.

2414
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:35,685
We've got Alice
on the UCLA node,

2415
01:35:35,685 --> 01:35:37,650
Saurab connected
to Arizona node,

2416
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:40,515
and Bob to Osaka.

2417
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:45,150
So I just play
the video next.

2418
01:35:45,150 --> 01:36:15,090
[NOISE]

2419
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,680
Is there audio available?

2420
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:36,199
I'm just completed.
[BACKGROUND]

2421
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,560
>> [BACKGROUND]

2422
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,210
>> Yeah. That's good.

2423
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,520
Can just explain it as

2424
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,530
the video plays.
Thank you.

2425
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:58,230
Let me just increase
the resolution first.

2426
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,810
I just wanted to show you

2427
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:06,950
the policy that we're

2428
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:08,420
using that I
just described.

2429
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,315
We got policy,1 where
it shall access

2430
01:37:11,315 --> 01:37:12,350
all the streams under the

2431
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:16,050
prefix ndn/org/md2k.

2432
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:20,400
This is for
request for Alice.

2433
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,120
Policy 2, we've got
Bob who shall access

2434
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,170
all the streams under

2435
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:33,125
the ndn/org/md2k prefix,

2436
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:37,400
but we deny the GPS
stream for that user.

2437
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,530
And for user 3,
that's Saurab,

2438
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:41,870
they shall access
all data under

2439
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:45,905
semantic location collected
at home location.

2440
01:37:45,905 --> 01:37:47,570
This is the runner script

2441
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,880
that's basically
running the repo,

2442
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,440
the controller
and producer.

2443
01:37:56,470 --> 01:38:00,830
So here we have
the runner script.

2444
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:04,580
So we're running
the mGuard server

2445
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,575
and we have advertised

2446
01:38:06,575 --> 01:38:09,560
the md2k prefix as well.

2447
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,455
Next we will move on
to the consumer end.

2448
01:38:12,455 --> 01:38:15,300
So we've got
three consumers.

2449
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:28,355
The first one is Bob.

2450
01:38:28,355 --> 01:38:30,455
If we go back
to the policy,

2451
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:32,795
Bob should be allowed

2452
01:38:32,795 --> 01:38:34,535
two of the three prefixes.

2453
01:38:34,535 --> 01:38:37,040
They're not allowed
the GPS stream.

2454
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,570
So we can see
that they can

2455
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:41,360
subscribe to any
of those stream.

2456
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,700
The battery and GPS

2457
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,305
semantic location stream,

2458
01:38:45,305 --> 01:38:47,195
we will try and
subscribe to both.

2459
01:38:47,195 --> 01:38:48,710
Here we get the data for

2460
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:51,515
semantic location
and battery.

2461
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:54,320
You can see that
there's batches

2462
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,850
of data being produced

2463
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:58,570
because our producer is

2464
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:00,745
generating data
in batches.

2465
01:39:00,745 --> 01:39:04,660
And as it inserts the
data into the repo,

2466
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,520
the consumer gets
a notification

2467
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,630
and then it fetches it.

2468
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:09,310
So it's going
continuously.

2469
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,620
So it's real time.

2470
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,230
Next, we've got Alice.

2471
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:14,855
Alice is the one with

2472
01:39:14,855 --> 01:39:16,220
the policy where they can

2473
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:19,590
actually fetch all
of the streams.

2474
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,515
We ran into an
error. [LAUGHTER] So

2475
01:39:30,515 --> 01:39:32,300
I had to do this again.

2476
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:36,140
So all three streams
available for Alice.

2477
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:40,350
Let's just subscribe
to one, I guess.

2478
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,980
We've subscribed to

2479
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,750
the GPS stream
and then Alice

2480
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,460
gets all of the GPS

2481
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,830
related data that
they subscribe to.

2482
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,290
And finally,

2483
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:08,165
the last consumer that
we have is Saurab.

2484
01:40:08,165 --> 01:40:09,920
In Saurab's policy,

2485
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,960
we mentioned that they
can only access data

2486
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:15,785
related to the semantic
location stream

2487
01:40:15,785 --> 01:40:18,440
and the attribute also

2488
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,880
states that they should be

2489
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,140
able to access data

2490
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:24,420
generated only at
home location.

2491
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:28,640
They're are only
allowed to subscribe to

2492
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,695
one stream and
when we do that,

2493
01:40:30,695 --> 01:40:33,305
we can note that
the data that they

2494
01:40:33,305 --> 01:40:37,055
get are all generated
in the home location.

2495
01:40:37,055 --> 01:40:39,500
If we go back to Bob,

2496
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,960
we can see that they
were able to access

2497
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,240
all semantic location data

2498
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,130
generated in
different locations,

2499
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:49,325
like shopping mall,
home, gym, work.

2500
01:40:49,325 --> 01:40:50,675
But in Saurab's case,

2501
01:40:50,675 --> 01:40:51,950
it was just home base.

2502
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:54,830
What our policy
was defined

2503
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:57,995
for and that's what
the user wanted.

2504
01:40:57,995 --> 01:41:00,380
That is the end of
our demo. Thank you.

2505
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:09,510
[APPLAUSE] Are there
any questions?

2506
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,210
Yeah. If there's anything,

2507
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,620
you can put it into
Slack as well.

2508
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,109
>> My question is

2509
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:29,930
[NOISE] [inaudible]?

2510
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,910
>> Yeah. So currently

2511
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,830
we're using data
generation,

2512
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:36,230
where I think
we're generating

2513
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:40,235
like 120 data
points per minute.

2514
01:41:40,235 --> 01:41:41,780
And then we use sleeper

2515
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:44,195
while and then
send it again.

2516
01:41:44,195 --> 01:41:45,920
Since we do not have

2517
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,120
access to them
to get data,

2518
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:48,980
we've created a
library where we

2519
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:51,990
generated data and
then run our program.

2520
01:41:52,090 --> 01:42:02,430
Thank you. We've got
another question. Yeah.

2521
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,440
>> [NOISE] Is that
better? I may

2522
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,940
have not been paying
good attention,

2523
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,050
but did I see that your

2524
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:13,910
access control
policy includes

2525
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:17,255
both deny and allow
as operations?

2526
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:17,840
>> Yes.

2527
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,020
>> How do you mitigate
interactions of

2528
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:24,380
those to prevent
impossible situations?

2529
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,000
So it's just a
curiosity question.

2530
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,560
>> Yeah. I guess,

2531
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,530
we need somebody
to evaluate

2532
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,150
the user control policy

2533
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,695
because a user
get to decide.

2534
01:42:33,695 --> 01:42:35,690
And we were
discussing that,

2535
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,370
what if a user adds in

2536
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,290
one attribute filter allow

2537
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:40,160
this policy and in

2538
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,840
the second
attribute filter

2539
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,535
deny that same thing.

2540
01:42:43,535 --> 01:42:45,500
So I guess we will
need to implement

2541
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,860
a feature to prevent
that from happening.

2542
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,190
>> The parser will detect

2543
01:42:58,190 --> 01:43:00,710
all the conflicts and

2544
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:02,675
will warn the user

2545
01:43:02,675 --> 01:43:05,180
there's conflicts
in the policies.

2546
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:05,675
>> Yeah.

2547
01:43:05,675 --> 01:43:07,070
>> So that's similar then

2548
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:08,390
to the vasec compiler
[OVERLAPPING].

2549
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,425
>> Yeah. Exactly.

2550
01:43:09,425 --> 01:43:11,780
>> Where it won't

2551
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,825
compile if you create
a logical mismatch.

2552
01:43:14,825 --> 01:43:16,040
>> Right. Exactly.

2553
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,160
>> They seem very
adamant that denial

2554
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:22,460
by default was an
important thing for users.

2555
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,140
So I've been keeping
that thought.

2556
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,940
So this is just the topic

2557
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:28,025
to discuss. Nothing
meaningful.

2558
01:43:28,025 --> 01:43:30,740
>> Yeah. The parser checks

2559
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:34,170
all the potential
logic errors.

2560
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,640
Thank you, Dr. Wong.

2561
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,425
>> Thank you.

2562
01:43:39,425 --> 01:43:47,630
>> Thank you.
[APPLAUSE] So

2563
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:51,320
our next speaker
or title for

2564
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,820
this speaker is is

2565
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:56,000
NDN opportunity in
5G, 6G core networks.

2566
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,570
And this is from
Junxiao Shi.

2567
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,550
Junxiao is a computer and

2568
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,810
information scientist
at National

2569
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:04,895
Institute of Standards
and Technology.

2570
01:44:04,895 --> 01:44:06,710
He is a core NDN developer

2571
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:07,550
and has been developing

2572
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:10,640
NDN network for
[inaudible] since 2013.

2573
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,410
He also enjoys
building websites

2574
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,450
and browser-based
NDN applications.

2575
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:20,660
>> Hi, my name
is Junxiao Shi.

2576
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:23,195
Today I'm presenting
NDN opportunities

2577
01:44:23,195 --> 01:44:26,340
in 5G and 6G
core networks.

2578
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:30,275
In this presentation,
I will first give

2579
01:44:30,275 --> 01:44:32,300
a very brief
introduction of

2580
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,370
a 5G core network
architecture,

2581
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:36,335
especially its control and

2582
01:44:36,335 --> 01:44:38,870
user plan separation
principle.

2583
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:41,090
Then I will talk
about ideas on

2584
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,220
how to run NDN
application over

2585
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:46,490
5G network and how
to simplify 5G

2586
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:51,035
and 6G core architecture
with NDN ideas.

2587
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:55,310
First, let me introduce
the 5G architecture.

2588
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:57,920
In the 5G network, first,

2589
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,930
we can have the
user equipment,

2590
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,930
UE, such as your
smartphone or tablet.

2591
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:05,540
The UE connects tools
that you know the beat,

2592
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:08,915
which is the component
in the cellular tower

2593
01:45:08,915 --> 01:45:10,610
and it's these two forms

2594
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:12,830
the radio access network.

2595
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:14,840
On the other side, it's

2596
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,924
the data network,
usually the Internet.

2597
01:45:17,924 --> 01:45:20,935
And between the
radio access network

2598
01:45:20,935 --> 01:45:22,630
and the data network,

2599
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:23,920
all the services are

2600
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,995
provided by the
5G core network.

2601
01:45:26,995 --> 01:45:28,750
5G core network,

2602
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:31,950
contains many different
network functions.

2603
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:34,640
And in the 5G standard,

2604
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,200
they're separated into

2605
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,045
the control plane
and the user plane,

2606
01:45:38,045 --> 01:45:39,800
so that each
partner can be

2607
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,710
deployed and scaled
independently.

2608
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:45,890
And this helps with the
5G network slicing,

2609
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:48,410
which is a new
property in 5G.

2610
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,360
The control plane has

2611
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,700
many network
versions providing

2612
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,205
services such as
authentication,

2613
01:45:55,205 --> 01:45:56,735
morbidity management,

2614
01:45:56,735 --> 01:45:59,435
IP address or
location and so on.

2615
01:45:59,435 --> 01:46:02,404
The user plane implements

2616
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:04,280
the data plane
functionality,

2617
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,755
including packet
routing and forwarding,

2618
01:46:06,755 --> 01:46:08,495
traffic usage reporting,

2619
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:11,070
and the QoS handling.

2620
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,150
And NDN can be applied to

2621
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:16,055
both user plane
and control plane,

2622
01:46:16,055 --> 01:46:18,305
but let's first talk
about the user plane,

2623
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:21,950
how to run NDN applications
over 5G network.

2624
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:23,830
The use case I want to

2625
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:26,020
cover is a live
video streaming,

2626
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:29,320
such as concerts or live

2627
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,595
news report from

2628
01:46:30,595 --> 01:46:32,865
a 5G phone to
worldwide viewers.

2629
01:46:32,865 --> 01:46:34,385
On the left, we have

2630
01:46:34,385 --> 01:46:37,010
our streamer
using a 5G phone

2631
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:38,060
and their cameras,

2632
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,760
they want to stream
to viewers around

2633
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,125
the world and
as the phone is

2634
01:46:42,125 --> 01:46:44,510
attached to one of
the 5G networks.

2635
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:47,120
Then there would
be viewers on

2636
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:50,810
phones on the
same 5G network.

2637
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,460
There could that
be viewers on

2638
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,395
a different 5G network

2639
01:46:54,395 --> 01:46:56,510
and there could
be viewers in

2640
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,850
front of their computers
on the Internet.

2641
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,020
The baseline
scenario that we can

2642
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,150
already do today
is everyone

2643
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,100
connect to NDN routers on

2644
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,395
the Internet through
UDP tunnels.

2645
01:47:09,395 --> 01:47:11,600
The streamer has
a UDP tunnel to

2646
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,075
a router outside
of the 5G network.

2647
01:47:14,075 --> 01:47:16,190
And all the viewers
also connect

2648
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:21,545
to NDN forwraders outside.

2649
01:47:21,545 --> 01:47:25,250
But this approach
can be done today,

2650
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,990
but it has
drawbacks because

2651
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:28,640
the 5G network doesn't

2652
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,260
know anything about NDN.

2653
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:32,480
So that it doesn't
have caching.

2654
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,610
The same data
packet would flow

2655
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:37,010
through the 5G core
network multiple times,

2656
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:38,570
which yields
more bandwidth.

2657
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:40,580
And as the 5G
core network has

2658
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,790
a very limited QoS
control because as far as

2659
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,360
the 5G can see

2660
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,625
is they're UDP
tunnel, UDP packets.

2661
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:51,365
They don't see
their names.

2662
01:47:51,365 --> 01:47:54,110
There is no way
to prioritize

2663
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:55,340
video traffic over

2664
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,485
download traffic
for example.

2665
01:47:57,485 --> 01:48:01,400
So to improve, we want

2666
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,495
to add NDN forward into
the 5G core network.

2667
01:48:05,495 --> 01:48:07,610
Earlier I mentioned that

2668
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:09,200
the UPF user plane

2669
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,990
function implements
data plane.

2670
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:31,200
>> So you muted.
Sure you're back.

2671
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:38,870
>> So as NDN User Plane

2672
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:40,910
Function is on
NDN Forwarders

2673
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:43,280
that sets us apart

2674
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,670
stateful forwarding an
caching functionality.

2675
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:50,420
Since it's a five GOPF
it to show that also

2676
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:51,560
support high traffic or

2677
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,470
usage reporting and
some QoS handling.

2678
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,360
With on the IP UPF in

2679
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:00,325
the 5G Core if
you are user,

2680
01:49:00,325 --> 01:49:01,975
incremental
suppose and yet

2681
01:49:01,975 --> 01:49:03,550
it controls to
connect with

2682
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:06,160
the NDN data network
in addition to

2683
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,720
the IP data network and

2684
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:10,185
both current at
the same time.

2685
01:49:10,185 --> 01:49:12,980
Then since the
5G Core network

2686
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:14,090
are usually performance

2687
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:15,620
a centralized control so

2688
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:17,180
that in the control plane,

2689
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:19,910
we want to add application
and finishing.

2690
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:22,430
It will provide those
services such as

2691
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:24,155
the preferred registration

2692
01:49:24,155 --> 01:49:26,150
or producer
mobility support,

2693
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:28,505
and a centralized routing.

2694
01:49:28,505 --> 01:49:31,310
Waste and the IUPF in

2695
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:34,829
the 5G Core can
enhance that scenario.

2696
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,730
As a streamer and
as a viewer says,

2697
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:40,159
they will connect
to the NDN UPF

2698
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:42,230
within their 5G network,

2699
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:45,410
and since NDN UPF,
contains a forwarder.

2700
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:47,885
So we can have interests
aggregation and

2701
01:49:47,885 --> 01:49:50,600
the network occasion
within the 5G network.

2702
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:55,290
Or we can also have
name based QoS.

2703
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:59,285
Apart from the user plane,

2704
01:49:59,285 --> 01:50:01,430
we can also add IUPF into

2705
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:03,965
5G Core network
control plane.

2706
01:50:03,965 --> 01:50:08,039
And simplify the control
plane architecture.

2707
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:14,270
Since it's a 5G Core
network diagram,

2708
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:16,370
it has many
different functions

2709
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:18,290
So we want to just improve

2710
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:19,490
the control plane since it

2711
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:22,985
has led to network are
quite complicated.

2712
01:50:22,985 --> 01:50:25,910
So we'll improve. Here is

2713
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:27,620
a 5G control
plane currently

2714
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,660
has a service-based
architecture

2715
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:32,810
[inaudible] for follow
Microsoft's approach.

2716
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:34,085
What it means is,

2717
01:50:34,085 --> 01:50:35,735
all the control
plane functions

2718
01:50:35,735 --> 01:50:37,655
are connected that
to a virtual bus.

2719
01:50:37,655 --> 01:50:40,685
It's currently realized
as the IP subnet.

2720
01:50:40,685 --> 01:50:42,470
And as there is a unified

2721
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,985
protocol stack rates on

2722
01:50:43,985 --> 01:50:47,375
HTTP tool transport
and the JSON encoding.

2723
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,730
So the benefit of adopting

2724
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:52,865
service-based architecture
is to have less

2725
01:50:52,865 --> 01:50:54,845
complex in their
communication

2726
01:50:54,845 --> 01:50:56,630
and a better
scalability since

2727
01:50:56,630 --> 01:50:58,715
it allows,each
network function

2728
01:50:58,715 --> 01:51:01,425
will be scaled
independently.

2729
01:51:01,425 --> 01:51:04,360
One off, the
network function in

2730
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,045
the service-based
architecture is the NRF,

2731
01:51:07,045 --> 01:51:09,370
or Network
Repository Function.

2732
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:11,650
It provides a
service discovery

2733
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:13,390
to this IP subnet.

2734
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,845
The way it works is

2735
01:51:14,845 --> 01:51:16,270
every network
function need

2736
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,815
to know where is NRF.

2737
01:51:17,815 --> 01:51:19,450
It's a pre-configured with

2738
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:22,105
NRFs IP address and
the port number.

2739
01:51:22,105 --> 01:51:24,560
That every network
function where to start

2740
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,230
it were rigid
itself with NRF.

2741
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:28,670
Well, one network function

2742
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:29,840
want to talk to another.

2743
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,295
It's a need to ask

2744
01:51:31,295 --> 01:51:34,220
the NRF where is the
other network version?

2745
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:37,025
Ask her for its IP
address and port number.

2746
01:51:37,025 --> 01:51:38,270
So as an example is

2747
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:39,920
the AMF access and

2748
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,600
the mobility
management fishing,

2749
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,970
neither to talk
to the AUSF,

2750
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:45,800
I sent a caching
server function

2751
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,975
during user
authentication.

2752
01:51:47,975 --> 01:51:51,575
So way it works is when
a USF initially start

2753
01:51:51,575 --> 01:51:55,670
it need reduce its own
IP and port with NRF.

2754
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:58,295
Then NRF remembers
that information

2755
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:00,770
when AMF want to
talk to AUSF,

2756
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,150
it ask the NRF,

2757
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:05,180
where is AUSF and
a better answer.

2758
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:08,210
Only after that,
AMF can talk to

2759
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,950
the AUSF because it

2760
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:11,690
doesn't know
its IP address.

2761
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:16,230
And AUSF was under the
response to the AMF.

2762
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:20,180
When we replace
IP with NDN we

2763
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,730
still have the
service-based architecture,

2764
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:24,350
all the control
plane functions are

2765
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:26,090
connected to a
virtual bus,

2766
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:28,775
but now it is NDN
local area network.

2767
01:52:28,775 --> 01:52:30,380
And we still have

2768
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,195
a unified the
protocol stack

2769
01:52:32,195 --> 01:52:34,370
which is now NDN
transporter.

2770
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:36,215
And the JSON encoding.

2771
01:52:36,215 --> 01:52:38,330
But instead of NRF,

2772
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,025
we don't need it anymore.

2773
01:52:40,025 --> 01:52:41,060
We can perform

2774
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:44,910
a service discovery
using NDN naming.

2775
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:49,055
Since the network
onboarding,

2776
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:52,220
we can notice network
name is example 5G.

2777
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,675
So AMF can derive

2778
01:52:53,675 --> 01:52:58,205
the AUSF name is
example 5G/ AUSF.

2779
01:52:58,205 --> 01:53:00,125
So it can send
this interest

2780
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:01,880
to the local area network.

2781
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:04,280
And because the local
area network currents

2782
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,375
and the self-learning.

2783
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:07,700
So self-learning
forwarding strategy can

2784
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,535
find as a forwarding
path where it's AUSF.

2785
01:53:10,535 --> 01:53:12,530
And if there are
multiple instance

2786
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:13,925
of AUS deployed,

2787
01:53:13,925 --> 01:53:16,715
it can also help
with load balancing.

2788
01:53:16,715 --> 01:53:19,430
The interests
goes to AUSF and

2789
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:24,330
AUSF can respond a
wizard data to the AMF.

2790
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:28,610
That's how we simplify
the 5G control plane.

2791
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,499
To sum up, I presented

2792
01:53:30,499 --> 01:53:33,755
a two opportunities
in the 5G network.

2793
01:53:33,755 --> 01:53:36,860
One is adding
a forwarded to

2794
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,270
the 5G user plane to

2795
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,625
enable stateful forwarding

2796
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,855
and the network caching.

2797
01:53:41,855 --> 01:53:43,879
The other is simplify

2798
01:53:43,879 --> 01:53:45,530
5G control plane waste and

2799
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,540
beyond sexual as the
service discovery

2800
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:49,820
and some other
features are possible.

2801
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:51,500
But these are just ideas.

2802
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:52,625
So our future work

2803
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,320
is we need to
think about as

2804
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,430
a protocol design

2805
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:58,040
and prototype
implementation.

2806
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:06,020
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

2807
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,900
>> So thank you
Junxiao, let's see.

2808
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:11,280
Are there any
questions in the room?

2809
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:15,935
>> I have a quick
question if I may.

2810
01:54:15,935 --> 01:54:17,840
>> Go ahead, please.

2811
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,585
>> Junxiao, the
fantastic idea,

2812
01:54:20,585 --> 01:54:22,100
but are you aware of

2813
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,800
any network equipment
vendors that are

2814
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,540
open in that core network

2815
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:28,950
at the moment that
you could do this on?

2816
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:31,880
>> There's a core network

2817
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,905
is entirely a
software-based,

2818
01:54:33,905 --> 01:54:35,585
so it's that g node B or

2819
01:54:35,585 --> 01:54:38,960
UE is in useers hands
I cannot change,

2820
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,315
and g node B is
the hardware.

2821
01:54:41,315 --> 01:54:43,340
But as a core network
it's software,

2822
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,720
it's the containers, so we

2823
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,250
can change it very easily.

2824
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:47,630
And as they are
open-source ones,

2825
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:49,560
there are commercial ones.

2826
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:51,980
>> On Nokia,

2827
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,630
Ericsson or
anybody's equipment?

2828
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:58,970
>> This equipment are
usually g node B.

2829
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:01,310
But core is open.

2830
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,070
Why it won't open
example such as open

2831
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:08,970
5GS and the 35GC is
the open source.

2832
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:12,410
>> You've just solved
a huge problem for us.

2833
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,770
Thank you.

2834
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:17,010
[LAUGHTER] We
need to talk.

2835
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:21,120
>> Other questions online?

2836
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:23,480
So there's one on Slack,

2837
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,515
I'm going to read it.

2838
01:55:24,515 --> 01:55:26,000
You showed a technology

2839
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,380
where the UEs connect to

2840
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:31,190
a single anchor,
NDN enabled UPF.

2841
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,420
What are your thoughts on

2842
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,640
the possibility of
mobility management using

2843
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,440
unique end to end
features such as

2844
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:39,350
simplified and
careless mobility?

2845
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:42,320
>> Roaming, produce
and morbidity.

2846
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,300
Yes, it's possible we can

2847
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:47,090
use either NDN user
producer morbidity

2848
01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:49,550
and we can also
assist to it

2849
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:51,260
with the NDN application

2850
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,580
of function in a
control plane.

2851
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:59,960
>> Thank you, Junxiao.

2852
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:09,035
[APPLAUSE] Our third talk

2853
01:56:09,035 --> 01:56:11,030
is from Edmond Yeh,

2854
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:14,674
from Northeastern
University,

2855
01:56:14,674 --> 01:56:17,300
is going to work in
NDN for quite a bit.

2856
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:18,575
The title of the talk is

2857
01:56:18,575 --> 01:56:21,230
N-DISE NDN base data
distribution for

2858
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:22,700
large-scale data intensive

2859
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:25,530
science experiments.

2860
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:31,250
>> Can you hear me?

2861
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:33,725
>> We can hear you.

2862
01:56:33,725 --> 01:56:36,485
>> So thanks for
the opportunity.

2863
01:56:36,485 --> 01:56:38,840
I have 20 minutes.
Is that correct?

2864
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:43,560
>> Yes, 16 for
discussions.

2865
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:46,100
>> Great. Well,

2866
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,690
I just wanted to give
you an update on

2867
01:56:47,690 --> 01:56:49,340
this N-DISE project,

2868
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:53,374
which is an NSF
funded project

2869
01:56:53,374 --> 01:56:54,590
for using NDN for

2870
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,809
data intensive
science experiments.

2871
01:56:56,809 --> 01:56:58,850
And we have actually
a number of

2872
01:56:58,850 --> 01:56:59,900
people involved with this

2873
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:02,045
project including NIST.

2874
01:57:02,045 --> 01:57:04,430
So the idea is
that we have

2875
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:06,800
many large-scale data

2876
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,720
intensive science
applications,

2877
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,790
including Large
Hadron Collider

2878
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,500
is high-energy physics,

2879
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,570
astrophysics applications,

2880
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:16,190
genomics applications

2881
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:19,505
that share similar
challenges.

2882
01:57:19,505 --> 01:57:21,320
And the challenges are

2883
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,715
that they need to index,

2884
01:57:22,715 --> 01:57:24,590
they need to
secure storage.

2885
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:26,690
>> Edmond can you
go full screen?

2886
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:36,380
>> Oh, sorry.

2887
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:40,235
So here we are. Thanks
for the reminder.

2888
01:57:40,235 --> 01:57:42,590
They share a similar set

2889
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,300
of problems in indexing,

2890
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,460
securing, storing,
distributing,

2891
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,815
analyzing, and learning
from the data,

2892
01:57:48,815 --> 01:57:50,630
coordinated use
of computing,

2893
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,595
storage and
network resources.

2894
01:57:52,595 --> 01:57:54,560
And as it is today,

2895
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,730
these domain experts are

2896
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:57,755
dealing with these
problems themselves.

2897
01:57:57,755 --> 01:58:01,010
And since they're not
network specialists,

2898
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:04,025
they have their
application needs.

2899
01:58:04,025 --> 01:58:07,730
They develop their
solutions in isolation,

2900
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:11,160
somewhat incrementally
replicated efforts.

2901
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,120
And this is mainly
due to the fact

2902
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,950
that there is a
gap that exists

2903
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:16,240
between the
application needs

2904
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:16,840
that they have and

2905
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,775
existing networks
and systems

2906
01:58:18,775 --> 01:58:20,350
which focus on addresses,

2907
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:22,585
processes, servers,
connections,

2908
01:58:22,585 --> 01:58:23,980
whereas the
application needs

2909
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,995
are really about data.

2910
01:58:25,995 --> 01:58:29,000
And so our
approach is to use

2911
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
ideas from NDN to develop

2912
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,740
a data-centric approach to

2913
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,480
system and network design

2914
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:37,010
that provides
support for data

2915
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:39,405
through the entire
data lifecycle,

2916
01:58:39,405 --> 01:58:41,785
from naming to
authentication to securing,

2917
01:58:41,785 --> 01:58:44,770
and the delivering
the data using names

2918
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:48,160
and scalable
data retrieval

2919
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:49,780
in network caching,

2920
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:51,925
automated joint caching
and forwarding,

2921
01:58:51,925 --> 01:58:54,670
multicast delivery
in order to

2922
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:55,840
enable network wide data

2923
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,700
intensive computation
and learning.

2924
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:03,039
So this is a big project

2925
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:05,590
and we want to develop
a common framework

2926
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:08,340
to support different
application domains.

2927
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,880
So this was launched

2928
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,400
actually already five
years ago now with

2929
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:18,320
the SANDIE project under
the CC* NSF program.

2930
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,900
Continued with the
N-DISE project

2931
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:23,285
in 2020 under the
same program.

2932
01:59:23,285 --> 01:59:26,525
It involves
Northeastern Caltech,

2933
01:59:26,525 --> 01:59:28,370
UCLA, Tennessee Tech.

2934
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:30,500
So our main focus
has been on

2935
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,780
the LHC program in
high-energy physics,

2936
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:33,350
which is one of

2937
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:34,190
the world's largest

2938
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,855
data-intensive
applications.

2939
01:59:35,855 --> 01:59:37,610
Its volume is set to grow

2940
01:59:37,610 --> 01:59:39,050
another 10 times due

2941
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:42,095
to high luminosity
experiments,

2942
01:59:42,095 --> 01:59:44,750
which are going to
happen in 2027.

2943
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:46,040
We're also interested in

2944
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,590
the genomic applications.

2945
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,240
The human genome data

2946
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:51,470
and earth bio genome data,

2947
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:54,350
which is also approaching
exabyte range.

2948
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:56,330
Though all of these
applications need to

2949
01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:58,100
use very diverse
computation,

2950
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,590
storage and
networking resources.

2951
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:02,060
And we would like to build

2952
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:04,505
an ecosystem to
support that.

2953
02:00:04,505 --> 02:00:07,490
The update that
I have is that

2954
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:10,820
the latest results are

2955
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:12,500
really from the
supercomputing

2956
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,645
2022 conference.

2957
02:00:14,645 --> 02:00:15,650
But let me recap a

2958
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:16,760
little bit what
we have done in

2959
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:19,010
this project up
to this point.

2960
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:21,500
We've developed a
data-centric naming scheme

2961
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,910
for a fast access

2962
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:24,710
and efficient
communication in

2963
02:00:24,710 --> 02:00:26,795
high-energy physics
and other fields.

2964
02:00:26,795 --> 02:00:29,720
So this involves
essentially translating

2965
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,520
naming scheme that
exists currently

2966
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,815
in high-energy
physics to NBN names.

2967
02:00:33,815 --> 02:00:35,960
We've implemented
and integrated

2968
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,610
jointly optimal
caching and

2969
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:40,430
forwarding algorithms
developed at

2970
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:42,395
Northeastern
some years ago.

2971
02:00:42,395 --> 02:00:44,210
We've integrated
the high-speed

2972
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,650
NDN-DPDK forwarder

2973
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:49,670
developed by NIST a
couple of years ago.

2974
02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:52,190
And we have developed

2975
02:00:52,190 --> 02:00:54,440
an NDN-DPDK base
consumer and

2976
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:56,450
producer application
developed by

2977
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:58,970
Caltech and
integrated that

2978
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:01,670
with the CMS
software stack.

2979
02:01:01,670 --> 02:01:03,950
CMS is one of the
big experiments

2980
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:06,110
in high energy physics,

2981
02:01:06,110 --> 02:01:10,880
Large Hadron
Collider geophysics.

2982
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,390
Integrated with
the CMS stack

2983
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:16,145
through the XRootD plugin,

2984
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:19,490
also developed by Caltech.

2985
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:22,805
We've started to

2986
02:01:22,805 --> 02:01:26,405
have FPGA acceleration
subsystems,

2987
02:01:26,405 --> 02:01:28,129
which are essentially
accelerate

2988
02:01:28,129 --> 02:01:29,360
the hashing function of

2989
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,000
the NDN-DPDK forwarder.

2990
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,280
And this is
produced by a group

2991
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:36,170
at UCLA and also

2992
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:38,240
the Tennessee Tech
Group has started

2993
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,940
to work on the
genomics application.

2994
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:43,130
And they've been doing
some interesting work

2995
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,305
on linking

2996
02:01:45,305 --> 02:01:48,245
NDN with Kubernetes
implementations.

2997
02:01:48,245 --> 02:01:50,495
The detailed results here

2998
02:01:50,495 --> 02:01:52,370
have appeared actually in

2999
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:55,580
the proceedings
of ACM ICN paper

3000
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:57,515
that we had in 2022,

3001
02:01:57,515 --> 02:01:59,750
which summarizes a
lot of these results.

3002
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:02,135
So for details, you
could go there.

3003
02:02:02,135 --> 02:02:04,310
I'm just going to
present some of

3004
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:07,295
the latest results
that we had from SC22,

3005
02:02:07,295 --> 02:02:11,510
where we had a major demo.

3006
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:13,340
In fact, we've had
demos actually

3007
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,230
for the last five
years or so,

3008
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:18,905
all the SC conferences
starting from SC18.

3009
02:02:18,905 --> 02:02:19,340
So we've

3010
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,200
gradually improved
their performance.

3011
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:26,735
So here what we
have is when

3012
02:02:26,735 --> 02:02:29,285
we have wide area network
that we have set up

3013
02:02:29,285 --> 02:02:32,360
consisting of five nodes,

3014
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:33,800
Northeastern, UCLA,

3015
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:36,200
Tennessee Tech,
Caltech, and Starlight.

3016
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,430
That's the persistent wide

3017
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:38,855
area network testbed.

3018
02:02:38,855 --> 02:02:40,430
Of course, at SC22,

3019
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:44,585
we also had a presence
at the SC22 booth.

3020
02:02:44,585 --> 02:02:47,210
So these links
tell you about

3021
02:02:47,210 --> 02:02:48,740
the propagation delays and

3022
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:51,380
the speed of the
various links.

3023
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:53,960
So this is really
a continental

3024
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:56,105
wide area network testbed

3025
02:02:56,105 --> 02:02:58,175
over which we're
testing this.

3026
02:02:58,175 --> 02:03:03,740
I forgot to mention

3027
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,900
that through the
collaboration

3028
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,770
of various partners,

3029
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:09,065
we're able to
provision VLANs,

3030
02:03:09,065 --> 02:03:13,309
which allow us
to implement

3031
02:03:13,309 --> 02:03:15,575
NDN protocols at layer 2

3032
02:03:15,575 --> 02:03:18,560
of this wide area network.

3033
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,780
So let me talk a
little bit about

3034
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:23,180
what performance we
were able to get.

3035
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:26,540
This is from new
consumers at

3036
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,800
the SC22 booth and

3037
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,530
Starlight and one
producer at Caltech.

3038
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,170
We had 100 gigabit per

3039
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,700
second tagged
VLAN connections

3040
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:36,140
to both consumers,

3041
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:37,805
with each forwarder using

3042
02:03:37,805 --> 02:03:39,590
six forwarding threads and

3043
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:42,005
each consumer
server running

3044
02:03:42,005 --> 02:03:44,840
18 consumer
applications to request

3045
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:48,870
18 one gigabite
files named by CMS.

3046
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:54,875
This is a local
testbed at Caltech.

3047
02:03:54,875 --> 02:03:57,065
The local testbed gave us

3048
02:03:57,065 --> 02:04:02,120
around throughput of 96
gigabits per second.

3049
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:04,970
However, in the WAN,
we were able to get

3050
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:08,330
about 63 gigabits
per second with

3051
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:10,805
a fixed pipeline of

3052
02:04:10,805 --> 02:04:15,350
packets with 18
consumer applications

3053
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:18,140
running in parallel at
each consumer node.

3054
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:22,205
So this is a record
for us at SC22.

3055
02:04:22,205 --> 02:04:23,240
Certainly the best we've

3056
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,250
gotten over the years.

3057
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,890
We also tested the
caching performance.

3058
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:29,360
Here we're using
VIP caching,

3059
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:30,275
which was developed by

3060
02:04:30,275 --> 02:04:32,450
Northeastern
some years ago.

3061
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:34,790
We [inaudible] two
different topologies.

3062
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:36,680
One topology is a
service topology,

3063
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:38,885
which basically
has fixed routing.

3064
02:04:38,885 --> 02:04:40,325
So we're just testing out

3065
02:04:40,325 --> 02:04:41,660
the caching performance.

3066
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:44,660
I won't go into all
the details here.

3067
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:48,485
But we compared
the caching

3068
02:04:48,485 --> 02:04:52,340
with the case of no
caching and with ARC,

3069
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:55,760
which is a variant
of LRU caching,

3070
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,650
which is actually
also used in

3071
02:04:57,650 --> 02:05:00,095
the NDN-DPDK
forwarder, I believe.

3072
02:05:00,095 --> 02:05:02,345
And you can see here that

3073
02:05:02,345 --> 02:05:06,020
the plots are in
terms of throughput,

3074
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,370
in terms of
delay, in terms

3075
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,290
of cache hit ratio.

3076
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:10,970
And in each case,

3077
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:12,515
actually the green,

3078
02:05:12,515 --> 02:05:15,725
which is the VIP
performance, was the best.

3079
02:05:15,725 --> 02:05:17,330
And in many cases

3080
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:18,800
the delay was
decreased quite

3081
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,290
substantially and
throughput increased

3082
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:23,495
and cache hit
ratios increased.

3083
02:05:23,495 --> 02:05:29,435
So this is just
with fixed routing,

3084
02:05:29,435 --> 02:05:30,650
and then we also tested it

3085
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:32,750
with a multipath topology.

3086
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:35,690
Here, the difference
is that you can do

3087
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:38,720
joint caching and routing
at the same time.

3088
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:40,925
So you're
dynamically choosing

3089
02:05:40,925 --> 02:05:43,190
the route taken by

3090
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:45,605
the request as well as
the caching policy.

3091
02:05:45,605 --> 02:05:48,800
And here, actually, again,

3092
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,050
VIP caching gave the
best performance

3093
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:52,325
in terms throughput,

3094
02:05:52,325 --> 02:05:55,190
delay, and cache
hit ratio.

3095
02:05:55,190 --> 02:05:59,660
So this is robust
performance

3096
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:02,105
across a number of
different topologies.

3097
02:06:02,105 --> 02:06:06,530
And the main theme
here is that because

3098
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:09,740
NDN has in network caching

3099
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:11,810
built into the
architecture,

3100
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:15,575
we can really
exploit that to use

3101
02:06:15,575 --> 02:06:17,165
an optimized joint

3102
02:06:17,165 --> 02:06:19,009
caching forwarding
strategy

3103
02:06:19,009 --> 02:06:20,494
to get great performance.

3104
02:06:20,494 --> 02:06:21,440
And since this is

3105
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,730
a data distribution
network,

3106
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:25,640
caching really plays
a huge role here.

3107
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:27,590
In LHC, for instance,

3108
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:29,855
caching is a very

3109
02:06:29,855 --> 02:06:33,725
significant component
of the architecture.

3110
02:06:33,725 --> 02:06:35,600
And here all we've done

3111
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,130
is actually to
combine that with

3112
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:40,610
the fast NDN-DPDK
forwarder to essentially

3113
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:42,410
extract the best
performance

3114
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,750
we can extract from
this combined system.

3115
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:47,540
Now, we have also

3116
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:50,450
actually integrated
that with

3117
02:06:50,450 --> 02:06:53,645
a CMS stack through
the XRootD plugin,

3118
02:06:53,645 --> 02:06:55,880
which was developed
by Caltech.

3119
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:58,040
Now, what is XRootD? It is

3120
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:59,420
a software
framework used for

3121
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:00,995
file management at CERN,

3122
02:07:00,995 --> 02:07:05,480
which is where the
experiments are conducted.

3123
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:09,500
It enables
developers in LHC

3124
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:11,210
and CMS to implement

3125
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:14,675
various types of plugins,

3126
02:07:14,675 --> 02:07:16,865
file systems,
caching security.

3127
02:07:16,865 --> 02:07:19,655
It's written in C++.

3128
02:07:19,655 --> 02:07:25,460
And the OSS plugin is
a C++ dynamic library.

3129
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:27,860
These are details of

3130
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:30,215
file operations and it

3131
02:07:30,215 --> 02:07:33,080
interfaces with the
Ceph file system.

3132
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:36,200
So what we've done is,

3133
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,580
this is Caltech group,

3134
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:40,055
has embedded what
is called an

3135
02:07:40,055 --> 02:07:42,845
NDNc consumer into
the XRootD plugin,

3136
02:07:42,845 --> 02:07:44,630
developed by
Catalin Lordache,

3137
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:45,935
one of our team members.

3138
02:07:45,935 --> 02:07:48,365
It translates each
file system which is

3139
02:07:48,365 --> 02:07:52,060
submitted in the CMS
system into NDN name.

3140
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:55,350
So for instance, this

3141
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:01,085
would be the NDN name

3142
02:08:01,085 --> 02:08:04,565
for open and fstat
and for read,

3143
02:08:04,565 --> 02:08:06,110
and then sends
the interests

3144
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:07,130
over the NDN network.

3145
02:08:07,130 --> 02:08:08,375
In other words, you can

3146
02:08:08,375 --> 02:08:10,610
submit a request
for a file

3147
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:12,050
or a certain file
operations in

3148
02:08:12,050 --> 02:08:14,420
XRootD would be translated
into an NDN name.

3149
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:15,890
And then from there go on

3150
02:08:15,890 --> 02:08:17,660
into an NDN network.

3151
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:21,530
So then it receives
data packs,

3152
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:22,910
validates them,
it replies to

3153
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:25,070
the XRootD worker threads.

3154
02:08:25,070 --> 02:08:28,760
So now at the present time

3155
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,325
when we did this
integration,

3156
02:08:31,325 --> 02:08:33,290
the throughput
that we get,

3157
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:35,314
so we implement

3158
02:08:35,314 --> 02:08:40,190
these things in
darker containers.

3159
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:42,125
Without going into
all of the details,

3160
02:08:42,125 --> 02:08:44,450
the performance
that we get with

3161
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:46,220
the XRootD Plugin
is substantially

3162
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:48,710
less than with the
pure NDN system.

3163
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:51,560
Right now we're getting
about six gigabits

3164
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,850
per second peak.

3165
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:54,200
Now why is that?

3166
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,700
Because if you
do it directly

3167
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:57,470
in NDN actually with

3168
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:59,930
the NDNc file
transfer client

3169
02:08:59,930 --> 02:09:01,190
is using two threads,

3170
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:02,570
one for encoding
interests and the

3171
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:04,415
other for reading
and decoding data.

3172
02:09:04,415 --> 02:09:05,810
The two threads operate

3173
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:08,030
asynchronously and
do not communicate.

3174
02:09:08,030 --> 02:09:10,460
This approach
eliminates overhead

3175
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:12,260
and benefits from
parallelization,

3176
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:13,640
which leads to
improve throughput.

3177
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:16,730
However, in the
XRootD OSS Plugin,

3178
02:09:16,730 --> 02:09:19,070
the configuration
that CMS only

3179
02:09:19,070 --> 02:09:21,605
allows for
synchronous requests.

3180
02:09:21,605 --> 02:09:28,190
And so each worker thread

3181
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:29,990
will read a
certain amount of

3182
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:31,460
data and then wait

3183
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:32,810
for the response
before continue.

3184
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:34,370
This really limits
throughputs.

3185
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:35,060
So this is one of

3186
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,320
the factors limiting
throughput.

3187
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,560
So we're still working
on this integration,

3188
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:41,225
but we expect to

3189
02:09:41,225 --> 02:09:42,680
improve the
performance there.

3190
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:44,645
But right now there
is this bottleneck

3191
02:09:44,645 --> 02:09:46,445
that's some limiting
throughput.

3192
02:09:46,445 --> 02:09:48,320
I have limited time,

3193
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,570
so I will say
that in terms

3194
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:51,940
of a little bit about

3195
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:54,085
FPGA acceleration
performance,

3196
02:09:54,085 --> 02:09:57,670
basically the FPGA
performance is being used

3197
02:09:57,670 --> 02:10:01,780
to accelerate the
SipHash function,

3198
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,460
which is used to

3199
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:06,200
handle variable
length names

3200
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,745
in the NDN forwarder.

3201
02:10:07,745 --> 02:10:09,590
And so far we've gotten

3202
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:12,860
about two times
acceleration

3203
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:14,690
in terms of decreasing

3204
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:16,940
the delay in terms of
doing the hashing.

3205
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:19,280
But we expect to improve
that performance.

3206
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,965
And that's still being

3207
02:10:21,965 --> 02:10:24,290
worked on by
the UCLA group.

3208
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:27,230
In terms of the
genomics application

3209
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:29,150
I'll just say
briefly that what

3210
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:30,800
has been done here

3211
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,780
is to essentially
connect NDN

3212
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:37,640
with a Kubernetes
infrastructure.

3213
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:43,310
Basically, there's the
Tennessee Tech group

3214
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:45,065
has created an
infrastructure to

3215
02:10:45,065 --> 02:10:46,460
transparently
place data and

3216
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:48,185
computation in a network.

3217
02:10:48,185 --> 02:10:52,100
And one can name
computations

3218
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:56,869
and map them into the
Kubernetes namespaces.

3219
02:10:56,869 --> 02:10:59,060
And so basically
I think what

3220
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,890
has happened is they've

3221
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:02,330
worked on this
translation of

3222
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:04,730
NDN names onto the
Kubernetes names.

3223
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:06,260
So there's an ability to

3224
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,225
name both data
and compute,

3225
02:11:08,225 --> 02:11:10,580
and allowing the
workflows to treat

3226
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:12,845
the network as a
distributed compute device.

3227
02:11:12,845 --> 02:11:13,640
I think there's a lot

3228
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,930
of potential here actually

3229
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:17,570
to connect NDN
with Kubernetes.

3230
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:18,665
I think this is a

3231
02:11:18,665 --> 02:11:21,440
very nice first step
that we've taken,

3232
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:25,040
but in the genomics
application context.

3233
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,360
But there's a
lot more work

3234
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,380
that has been done here.

3235
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:29,330
And due to limited time,

3236
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:31,010
I won't go into
too much of that.

3237
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:33,560
Now through
this process in

3238
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,900
the CND project and
the NDNs project,

3239
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,295
we actually
learned a lot of

3240
02:11:37,295 --> 02:11:39,020
valuable lessons
which might be

3241
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:40,610
useful for other groups.

3242
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:42,425
And let me talk
about that briefly.

3243
02:11:42,425 --> 02:11:44,779
So there are
various challenges

3244
02:11:44,779 --> 02:11:47,030
in mapping application
names to NDN names.

3245
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:48,350
So it turns out that

3246
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:50,900
the naming structure
various applications

3247
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,850
do not really
correspond to

3248
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:54,350
the underlying
hierarchical structure of

3249
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:56,255
the data organization
sometimes.

3250
02:11:56,255 --> 02:11:58,760
So this is true in
your CMS case where we

3251
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:01,129
had to do
additional mappings

3252
02:12:01,129 --> 02:12:03,919
to associate data objects
used by workflows

3253
02:12:03,919 --> 02:12:05,120
with data units directly

3254
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:06,905
used in network requests.

3255
02:12:06,905 --> 02:12:11,480
So the naming scheme of

3256
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:13,670
the application does not
really correspond to

3257
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:16,310
the structure of the
files necessarily.

3258
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:18,200
So you have to do
additional mapping.

3259
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:20,225
That's one of the
lessons we learned.

3260
02:12:20,225 --> 02:12:23,300
The other is,
we'll might want

3261
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,190
a decoupled control-plane
information from

3262
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,390
the forwarding threads

3263
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:27,920
because the
transmission in

3264
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,570
parsing of control
packets may

3265
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:29,960
interrupt

3266
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,460
the operation of the
forwarding threads,

3267
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,600
increasing the
queueing delay

3268
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:33,830
of interest and
data packets.

3269
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:36,290
And so what we did
was to allocate

3270
02:12:36,290 --> 02:12:37,820
dedicated threads
to generate

3271
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:39,845
and parse control
information.

3272
02:12:39,845 --> 02:12:42,050
That's another potentially

3273
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:43,640
very valuable lesson.

3274
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,900
One of the things we

3275
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:46,160
encountered is
the impact of

3276
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,620
middle boxes on NDN
based protocols.

3277
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:50,180
So when we were running

3278
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:52,085
these things over the
wide area network,

3279
02:12:52,085 --> 02:12:53,210
what happened was that

3280
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:54,380
a lot of the NDN packets

3281
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:57,065
got corrupted by
middle boxes.

3282
02:12:57,065 --> 02:12:59,450
So some of the
networks switches

3283
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:01,160
misidentified
the EtherType of

3284
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:05,410
NDN packets with
a bare VLAN tag,

3285
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,640
and so they inserted

3286
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:09,580
extra tag protocol
identified

3287
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,485
before the NDN EtherType,

3288
02:13:11,485 --> 02:13:15,475
resulting in
the NDN frame,

3289
02:13:15,475 --> 02:13:17,560
in the Ethernet
frame no longer

3290
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:19,510
being a valid NDN packet.

3291
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:21,400
So then subsequently all

3292
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:22,780
of these things
started being dropped.

3293
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:24,430
This was a big mystery

3294
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:26,590
to us that we
eventually solved.

3295
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:28,910
And we had to
actually go and

3296
02:13:28,910 --> 02:13:30,065
check every switch to

3297
02:13:30,065 --> 02:13:31,625
see whether this
was being done.

3298
02:13:31,625 --> 02:13:33,890
In the end, we used VXLAN,

3299
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:35,405
Virtual Extensible LANs,

3300
02:13:35,405 --> 02:13:36,920
encapsulation protocol

3301
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,480
to tunnel NDN packets over

3302
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:42,605
UDP/IP to avoid
this problem,

3303
02:13:42,605 --> 02:13:45,590
but this led to some
reduction in throughput.

3304
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:48,080
So this is definitely
a problem encountered.

3305
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,600
And then there's also

3306
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:51,710
a lot of system-dependent

3307
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:52,895
configuration tuning.

3308
02:13:52,895 --> 02:13:54,350
That is just when you

3309
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:55,370
actually operate

3310
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:56,690
this over a wide
area network.

3311
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:58,610
So we used Docker
containers to package

3312
02:13:58,610 --> 02:13:59,570
the forwarder,

3313
02:13:59,570 --> 02:14:01,129
consumer producer
applications.

3314
02:14:01,129 --> 02:14:03,980
However, you still
have to spend a lot

3315
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:07,850
of manual effort to
configure drivers,

3316
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:09,995
ensuring proper
storage, integrating

3317
02:14:09,995 --> 02:14:11,540
software stacks
into workflows with

3318
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:13,595
diverse server equipment,

3319
02:14:13,595 --> 02:14:16,640
OSS, networking
configuration.

3320
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:18,440
So this is definitely
a challenge.

3321
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:19,850
But what we've shown with

3322
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:23,090
this project is
that it is possible

3323
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:26,045
to put together what

3324
02:14:26,045 --> 02:14:28,729
is available in terms
of the NDN technology,

3325
02:14:28,729 --> 02:14:29,870
in terms of the forwarding

3326
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:32,090
and caching and so forth,

3327
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:36,125
and put it over an actual
wide-area network,

3328
02:14:36,125 --> 02:14:38,690
running a very
pretty high speeds

3329
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:41,165
and using directly or to

3330
02:14:41,165 --> 02:14:43,610
control using VLANS and

3331
02:14:43,610 --> 02:14:47,520
get pretty reasonable
performance.

3332
02:14:48,970 --> 02:14:51,785
This is the N-DISE team

3333
02:14:51,785 --> 02:14:53,870
with many members and

3334
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:55,400
I like to thank them all.

3335
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:58,250
And it's been
a great effort

3336
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:59,480
over a number of years.

3337
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,710
And special thanks to our

3338
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:02,225
partners from ESnet,

3339
02:15:02,225 --> 02:15:05,120
CENIC, StarLight,
Internet2, RNP.

3340
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:07,220
So a lot of partners
have helped

3341
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:09,710
us to make all of
this possible.

3342
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:11,990
This is really a
quite integration

3343
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:14,630
and deployment job.

3344
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:16,820
Though, as I said,

3345
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:19,520
these results are
presented in detail in

3346
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,700
our proceedings of
ICN 2022 paper,

3347
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,465
and there's also a NRE,

3348
02:15:26,465 --> 02:15:29,090
network research
exhibition document

3349
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:32,210
that you could
find from SC22.

3350
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:34,580
So let me skip
the rest of this

3351
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:37,470
in the interest of time.
Thank you very much.

3352
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:41,030
>> Let's thank the
speaker. Thank you.

3353
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:44,570
[APPLAUSE] So I'll start

3354
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:46,950
see if any questions
in the room?

3355
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:51,420
Any questions online?

3356
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:01,100
>> Can you guys hear me?

3357
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,075
>> Yes.

3358
02:16:02,075 --> 02:16:02,675
>> Yes.

3359
02:16:02,675 --> 02:16:04,640
>> I would agree with
your observation and

3360
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:06,500
finding on the lack of

3361
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,570
standardization
causes problems with

3362
02:16:08,570 --> 02:16:11,120
general purpose networking
equipment that you

3363
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:12,260
observe that we
did in some of

3364
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:14,700
our experimentation
as well.

3365
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:18,365
>> Thank you.

3366
02:16:18,365 --> 02:16:21,065
>> There's one
question online.

3367
02:16:21,065 --> 02:16:22,730
I had the same question
is from [inaudible].

3368
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:25,025
I'm wondering about

3369
02:16:25,025 --> 02:16:27,530
the bottleneck
for your testing.

3370
02:16:27,530 --> 02:16:28,580
I think you got up to

3371
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:30,620
60 something
gigabit per second.

3372
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:31,970
So the question
is, what do you

3373
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:33,440
see the next bottleneck
that needs to

3374
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:34,850
be addressed to achieve

3375
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:36,200
100 gigabit per second?

3376
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:45,910
>> Yeah. So we
can go into this.

3377
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:48,354
I think we were

3378
02:16:48,354 --> 02:16:51,445
running a lot of
threads simultaneously,

3379
02:16:51,445 --> 02:16:52,540
a lot of consumers, a lot

3380
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:53,560
of threads simultaneously.

3381
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:56,470
At some point,
the throughput

3382
02:16:56,470 --> 02:17:00,355
started to get
diminishing returns.

3383
02:17:00,355 --> 02:17:04,120
And I think that the
way that we're going

3384
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:07,780
to try to deal

3385
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:15,370
with this is to try

3386
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:25,435
to look at these pipelines
that we're using,

3387
02:17:25,435 --> 02:17:26,920
which were fixed pipelines

3388
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,735
of certain number
of packets.

3389
02:17:28,735 --> 02:17:30,895
We're not sure
whether those are

3390
02:17:30,895 --> 02:17:34,360
necessarily tuned
optimally and

3391
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:36,760
there's probably some
additional gains we

3392
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:40,375
could gain from that.

3393
02:17:40,375 --> 02:17:45,400
But we have to know
to a large extent.

3394
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:48,820
I think we will get 200
gigabits per second.

3395
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:51,520
It's a matter of

3396
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:53,020
tuning the number
of threads,

3397
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:55,780
number of consumers,
and the pipeline,

3398
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:57,340
the window that we use,

3399
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,665
which is a fixed
window right now,

3400
02:17:59,665 --> 02:18:04,750
and possibly if we use
adjustable window,

3401
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:07,690
we could possibly get
a better throughput.

3402
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:09,070
That's another
possibility.

3403
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:10,270
So we're still working on

3404
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:12,040
the actually
the congestion

3405
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:14,050
control aspect of this.

3406
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:15,880
So there are a couple of

3407
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,155
directions we could push

3408
02:18:17,155 --> 02:18:20,260
to try to improve
the performance.

3409
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,300
But I think it's

3410
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,415
within reach actually
on the local testbed,

3411
02:18:24,415 --> 02:18:27,370
we're already getting
90 gigabits per

3412
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:30,370
second so it's really over

3413
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:31,450
the wide area
network that we're

3414
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,160
having some gap

3415
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:36,730
and this is actually
a Wide Area Network,

3416
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:39,730
things are much
less controlled.

3417
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:42,220
>> Thank you.
There's a follow-on

3418
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:43,990
online that asks
if there are

3419
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:45,640
any performance
optimizations that

3420
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:47,965
are possible on
the producer side.

3421
02:18:47,965 --> 02:18:51,310
>> Yeah, so the
producer side,

3422
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:54,200
well one of the
things we do is

3423
02:18:55,310 --> 02:18:58,420
we put the datasets
that we're

3424
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:01,825
fetching in DRAM at
the producer side.

3425
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:04,000
But possibly there are

3426
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,305
other optimizations
that could be done.

3427
02:19:08,305 --> 02:19:09,520
I'm not sure exactly

3428
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:12,440
what they are
referring to.

3429
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:17,305
I'll be interested in
learning about that.

3430
02:19:17,305 --> 02:19:18,640
>> Thank you.

3431
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,095
>> I have one
more question

3432
02:19:20,095 --> 02:19:22,750
regarding your
Kubernetes integration.

3433
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:24,955
When you were
looking at that,

3434
02:19:24,955 --> 02:19:28,060
was it more
efficient to look at

3435
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:31,570
the storage interfaces
like the CSI or PVC,

3436
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:33,085
the persistent
volume claim,

3437
02:19:33,085 --> 02:19:35,290
more than networking
site interfaces

3438
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:38,140
when you started bringing
this into India?

3439
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:42,220
>> Good question.
[inaudible].

3440
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,270
Are you around to answer

3441
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:49,160
this because it's
really seismic project?

3442
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:52,060
>> So we look at both.

3443
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:53,605
We looked at PVC for

3444
02:19:53,605 --> 02:19:58,825
the storage and also
the network interface.

3445
02:19:58,825 --> 02:20:00,490
I think the
network interface

3446
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:02,605
was more straightforward.

3447
02:20:02,605 --> 02:20:07,549
Interfacing with PVC
had its own challenges.

3448
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:11,635
But we did both.

3449
02:20:11,635 --> 02:20:14,590
>> You actually
use both. We had

3450
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:15,850
a similar
experience looking

3451
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:20,185
at PVC. Thank you.

3452
02:20:20,185 --> 02:20:21,880
>> Thank you.

3453
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:23,950
>> Let's thank the
speaker one more time.

3454
02:20:23,950 --> 02:20:24,370
Thank you.

3455
02:20:24,370 --> 02:20:29,590
[APPLAUSE].

3456
02:20:29,590 --> 02:20:31,795
Our next talk is

3457
02:20:31,795 --> 02:20:34,120
edge information

3478
02:21:18,505 --> 02:21:20,350
wireless communications
platform.

3479
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:21,760
Also held senior positions

3480
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,789
at Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Erickson,

3481
02:21:24,789 --> 02:21:25,930
Alcatel-Lucent, where

3482
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,130
you let technology
initiatives,

3483
02:21:27,130 --> 02:21:29,035
solution development,
business development,

3484
02:21:29,035 --> 02:21:30,955
service delivery.

3485
02:21:30,955 --> 02:21:33,790
Prior Jeff worked at
Singular Wireless and

3486
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:35,140
BellSouth and technology

3487
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:37,550
and operations roles.

3488
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:39,840
>> Thank you. I
appreciate it.

3489
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,840
Can everybody
see my screen?

3490
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,090
>> Yes.

3491
02:21:43,090 --> 02:21:44,020
>> We can see it.

3492
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:45,400
>> Great, It's
great to be here.

3493
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:47,230
So I'm going t go through

3494
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:49,840
some review of edge
and what edge is

3495
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,435
because it's such
an emerging area

3496
02:21:52,435 --> 02:21:54,010
that it's helpful

3497
02:21:54,010 --> 02:21:54,910
to understand some of

3498
02:21:54,910 --> 02:21:56,020
the vernacular
and then I'll

3499
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:58,810
get to the information
management piece.

3500
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:01,495
Real quick time check.

3501
02:22:01,495 --> 02:22:05,320
Here at Dell, we'd been
doing research and I

3502
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:06,640
had a long list
of things we're

3503
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,440
interested in and
it's not by choice,

3504
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,270
the edge touches
everything,

3505
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:12,085
data management,
management of AI,

3506
02:22:12,085 --> 02:22:13,840
workloads, runtimes,

3507
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,700
execution environments,
orchestration,

3508
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:18,535
and the list is really
long because Edge

3509
02:22:18,535 --> 02:22:21,130
it's a new deployment
pattern similar

3510
02:22:21,130 --> 02:22:23,140
to Cloud or
telecommunications.

3511
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:25,480
So it touches quite
a few things,

3512
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:27,295
but not all equally.

3513
02:22:27,295 --> 02:22:29,860
So three real genesis to

3514
02:22:29,860 --> 02:22:32,560
the modern edge framework
that's appearing.

3515
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,090
So first of all, telecom,

3516
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:35,710
telecommunications
carriers

3517
02:22:35,710 --> 02:22:37,225
have been building edges,

3518
02:22:37,225 --> 02:22:39,880
really complex edges since

3519
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:43,690
the late '90s but it
started far before that

3520
02:22:43,690 --> 02:22:46,270
so really active
electronics

3521
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:47,530
being embedded deep into

3522
02:22:47,530 --> 02:22:48,910
their networks really

3523
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:49,990
started with the advent of

3524
02:22:49,990 --> 02:22:54,100
broadband communications
and the advent

3525
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,230
of cable modems and DSL.

3526
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:58,630
But it's progressed
far beyond there

3527
02:22:58,630 --> 02:23:00,715
with wireless
networks now and

3528
02:23:00,715 --> 02:23:03,715
eNodeB and a lot of
the capabilities

3529
02:23:03,715 --> 02:23:07,525
that we looked at in
June shells discussion.

3530
02:23:07,525 --> 02:23:09,160
So what we've learned

3531
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:10,660
from telecommunication and

3532
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:11,950
incorporating here is

3533
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:15,295
wide area service
delivery, very important.

3534
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:17,560
And then from
the IoT world

3535
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:18,670
that started emerging

3536
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:22,975
really mid last
decade, 2012-2015.

3537
02:23:22,975 --> 02:23:24,760
It's all about
device management.

3538
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:26,679
So how can I interface

3539
02:23:26,679 --> 02:23:29,485
the cyber and
physical worlds?

3540
02:23:29,485 --> 02:23:31,180
You perform
automation and do

3541
02:23:31,180 --> 02:23:33,070
a lot of very
interesting things.

3542
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:36,130
So everything from
cameras and multimedia

3543
02:23:36,130 --> 02:23:37,930
for a host of

3544
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:40,435
applications of
computer vision beyond,

3545
02:23:40,435 --> 02:23:42,730
as well as how
do I actuate and

3546
02:23:42,730 --> 02:23:46,015
control capabilities
are remote

3547
02:23:46,015 --> 02:23:49,360
from a data center or
from my operation.

3548
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:51,040
So we learned a lot

3549
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,005
there about device
management.

3550
02:23:53,005 --> 02:23:54,370
And then of course
cloud, which

3551
02:23:54,370 --> 02:23:56,440
emerged the decade
before that,

3552
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,720
in the 2000s timeframe.

3553
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,580
What we've really
learned about that

3554
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:02,725
is utility, consumption,

3555
02:24:02,725 --> 02:24:05,140
and how do you
manage resources

3556
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,165
elastically and
those are all

3557
02:24:07,165 --> 02:24:09,730
combining to
create this edge,

3558
02:24:09,730 --> 02:24:11,080
this world of edge.

3559
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:12,880
If you see up in the
left-hand corner,

3560
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:16,120
these are a lot
of the use cases

3561
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,460
we're seeing and they
are all interrelated.

3562
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:20,590
So the amount of
data intensity to

3563
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:22,870
manage analytics-based
workloads or

3564
02:24:22,870 --> 02:24:24,895
computer vision-based
workloads is

3565
02:24:24,895 --> 02:24:27,535
a tremendous amount of
data being generated.

3566
02:24:27,535 --> 02:24:30,520
And it's being generated
from a host of

3567
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:33,369
devices that are
very distributed.

3568
02:24:33,369 --> 02:24:35,260
Even if you go to
a single site,

3569
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:36,940
to a factory or
a military base,

3570
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:39,265
or a port or an airport,

3571
02:24:39,265 --> 02:24:42,175
even over that wide
area that could be

3572
02:24:42,175 --> 02:24:45,040
square kilometers or
mini square kilometers,

3573
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:46,420
you've got
devices that are

3574
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,640
producing immense
amount of data and they

3575
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,770
need to be able to
gain insights very

3576
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:53,620
quickly and then also you

3577
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:56,590
need to be able to
control capabilities with

3578
02:24:56,590 --> 02:25:00,490
very fine scale
and very fast.

3579
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:01,060
So this is where

3580
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:02,875
the latency
requirement comes in.

3581
02:25:02,875 --> 02:25:05,245
Even in retail
stores today,

3582
02:25:05,245 --> 02:25:07,750
their predominant
use cases around

3583
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:09,700
loss prevention so as

3584
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:10,570
you're scanning things

3585
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:11,740
out at a self-checkout,

3586
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:12,850
they've got to be able to

3587
02:25:12,850 --> 02:25:14,260
stop the process
if there's

3588
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,550
a problem before you

3589
02:25:15,550 --> 02:25:17,425
scan the next item
and you may think,

3590
02:25:17,425 --> 02:25:19,960
that happens in
terms of seconds,

3591
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,160
but you've got
to think about

3592
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,330
what has to happen there.

3593
02:25:22,330 --> 02:25:24,190
You have to capture video,

3594
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,840
you have to
scale the video,

3595
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:28,570
you have to perform
a inference function

3596
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:29,920
and identify
the object and

3597
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:31,270
match it against
a database,

3598
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:32,485
make sure it's a match.

3599
02:25:32,485 --> 02:25:34,405
And then if
there's a problem,

3600
02:25:34,405 --> 02:25:36,640
send a command
back to the point

3601
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:38,995
of sale to stop the
checkout process.

3602
02:25:38,995 --> 02:25:40,375
And you've got to do it

3603
02:25:40,375 --> 02:25:41,650
before someone picks up

3604
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:44,500
another item and scans
it. Really hard to do.

3605
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:46,585
So in any event, also,

3606
02:25:46,585 --> 02:25:48,130
data security
is a big issue

3607
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:49,990
because all of these
use cases I just talked

3608
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:51,460
about private
tremendous amount of

3609
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:53,020
data that you
want to ensure

3610
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:55,000
security and
governance around

3611
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,010
independent operations is

3612
02:25:57,010 --> 02:25:58,960
a big issue across almost

3613
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,430
every one of
these use cases

3614
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:02,530
that they cannot count on

3615
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:04,780
the reliability of
a network or cloud

3616
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:05,800
to be able to continue

3617
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:07,420
these workloads
have to run,

3618
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,340
vary continuously
or there's

3619
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:12,175
major business impact
if they break now.

3620
02:26:12,175 --> 02:26:14,440
And then lastly,
mobility management.

3621
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,985
And this is something that

3622
02:26:15,985 --> 02:26:17,830
we're working on
understanding.

3623
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:21,625
But if you go to a modern
factory these days,

3624
02:26:21,625 --> 02:26:24,110
the workloads are
moving around.

3625
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:25,560
Virtually all the material

3626
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,030
handling now is
being done by

3627
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:30,540
robots whether they're
operating forklifts,

3628
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:31,860
where they're
moving material

3629
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:33,105
from building
to buildings,

3630
02:26:33,105 --> 02:26:35,160
or they're a robot
that's running on

3631
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:37,860
a track and the operations

3632
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:40,389
people are
strapping gateways

3633
02:26:40,389 --> 02:26:42,010
to the back of these
robots and they're

3634
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:43,495
communicating with Wi-Fi

3635
02:26:43,495 --> 02:26:44,560
and they're
loading them with

3636
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:48,100
tasks via some local
area networks.

3637
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:49,990
It's just amazing
to see this,

3638
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:51,160
but we're also going to

3639
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:52,390
be running workloads in

3640
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:53,710
vehicles that are going

3641
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:55,360
to require Edge support.

3642
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,130
We're certainly going
to be running them

3643
02:26:57,130 --> 02:26:59,320
in soft form and

3644
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:01,240
robotic process
automation in

3645
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,310
a variety of
different frameworks.

3646
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:05,019
So mobility management

3647
02:27:05,019 --> 02:27:06,520
becomes really important.

3648
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:09,310
Every one of these use
cases interacts and it

3649
02:27:09,310 --> 02:27:12,685
creates quite a worthy
technical problem.

3650
02:27:12,685 --> 02:27:15,340
So we have to manage
network constraints,

3651
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:17,170
we have to manage
data mobility,

3652
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:19,450
computer vision is
a huge workload.

3653
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:21,280
A lot of people
see Edge is

3654
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,080
an enabler of
multi-cloud so that

3655
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,280
they can use Edge is

3656
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,290
a natural glue between
clouds and they can

3657
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:27,850
put different workload

3658
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:30,325
backends into
different clouds.

3659
02:27:30,325 --> 02:27:32,560
These are operational
workloads.

3660
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:34,660
They're not, IT,
there's some IT,

3661
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:36,835
but it's predominantly
operational

3662
02:27:36,835 --> 02:27:38,140
functions that
we're running.

3663
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:39,760
Of course, since
it's a large

3664
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,130
distributed systems
scale becomes an issue,

3665
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:43,630
cost becomes an issue and

3666
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:45,220
quite a few
technical challenges

3667
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:47,140
begin to appear as you
start running this.

3668
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,925
There aren't a lot of

3669
02:27:48,925 --> 02:27:51,280
distributed systems
in the world today.

3670
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:52,990
People say, clouds
distributed,

3671
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:55,720
well now cloud are
giant data centers

3672
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:57,280
that you use
the Internet or

3673
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:00,420
direct connection
to access.

3674
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:01,875
Really, I can
only think of

3675
02:28:01,875 --> 02:28:04,230
two very large-scale
distributed systems

3676
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:04,740
that operate

3677
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:06,615
one or telecommunications
networks.

3678
02:28:06,615 --> 02:28:08,160
And they operate
because they have

3679
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:10,560
highly standardized
protocols and interfaces

3680
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:12,900
around those that
allow them to

3681
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:15,075
interwork on a
global basis

3682
02:28:15,075 --> 02:28:17,160
and the other are
financial exchanges.

3683
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:18,660
And they've done
pretty much

3684
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,610
the same thing with APIs,

3685
02:28:20,610 --> 02:28:23,295
that when they're handling

3686
02:28:23,295 --> 02:28:24,945
settlements and all
the background,

3687
02:28:24,945 --> 02:28:26,700
those are very
distributed systems,

3688
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:28,260
globally distributed
and they

3689
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:29,850
have to inter-operate
and of course

3690
02:28:29,850 --> 02:28:30,300
they have to deal

3691
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:32,235
with financial
regulation and

3692
02:28:32,235 --> 02:28:36,060
the surety of handling
people's money.

3693
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,430
So if you think about

3694
02:28:38,430 --> 02:28:42,555
edge topology in
taxonomy around this,

3695
02:28:42,555 --> 02:28:44,730
we see the functional edge

3696
02:28:44,730 --> 02:28:46,815
and this is vehicles,

3697
02:28:46,815 --> 02:28:49,650
robots, metaverse
gateways,

3698
02:28:49,650 --> 02:28:51,180
etc, whatever you want.

3699
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:52,950
But very close, tens

3700
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:56,700
of square meters
of surface area,

3701
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:58,560
tens of millions
of locations,

3702
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:00,225
probably ultimately
hundreds of them.

3703
02:29:00,225 --> 02:29:01,665
But I like to be

3704
02:29:01,665 --> 02:29:05,205
conservative and
extremely low latency.

3705
02:29:05,205 --> 02:29:06,090
Everything has
to happen in

3706
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:07,199
less than two milliseconds

3707
02:29:07,199 --> 02:29:08,595
in many use cases,

3708
02:29:08,595 --> 02:29:10,230
if you look at,
for instance,

3709
02:29:10,230 --> 02:29:12,015
environmental
simulation or the

3710
02:29:12,015 --> 02:29:12,960
so-called named by

3711
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:14,820
Mark Zuckerberg metaverse,

3712
02:29:14,820 --> 02:29:16,710
if you look at
those, I mean,

3713
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:18,780
you're talking sub 100

3714
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:20,010
microseconds and

3715
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:22,770
heavy requirements in
the area of jitter.

3716
02:29:22,770 --> 02:29:23,850
And then of course in

3717
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,920
robotic control,
autonomous driving,

3718
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:27,660
the same thing if you've
got a vehicle that's

3719
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:30,690
operating at 70 miles
per hour it has

3720
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:33,210
to make decisions
in microseconds on

3721
02:29:33,210 --> 02:29:35,730
what to do as a
scenario develops.

3722
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:38,580
So very low latency,

3723
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:40,710
a very much
single use case.

3724
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:43,440
So the computation
that's placed in these,

3725
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:45,780
if you've got a
system that's

3726
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:48,105
operating a vehicle
or a forklift,

3727
02:29:48,105 --> 02:29:49,545
that's all it's
going to do.

3728
02:29:49,545 --> 02:29:51,810
It will not be handling
the inventory that

3729
02:29:51,810 --> 02:29:53,175
the forklift is carrying

3730
02:29:53,175 --> 02:29:54,840
or some other use case,

3731
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:56,490
it's going to
be targeted at

3732
02:29:56,490 --> 02:29:58,020
that very narrow set of

3733
02:29:58,020 --> 02:30:00,870
use cases for that
physical device.

3734
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:03,090
Then we look at
the far edge,

3735
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:04,530
so still pretty tight

3736
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:07,065
latency, say 5-10
milliseconds.

3737
02:30:07,065 --> 02:30:08,730
But now you start to look

3738
02:30:08,730 --> 02:30:10,905
at square kilometers
of coverage.

3739
02:30:10,905 --> 02:30:15,135
Large retail stores,
factories, ports,

3740
02:30:15,135 --> 02:30:20,160
utility locations
for power generation

3741
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:24,195
or upstream oil
exploration, etc mining.

3742
02:30:24,195 --> 02:30:26,220
Now you've got
square kilometers to

3743
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:29,040
cover and you have
general purpose compute.

3744
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,285
There will be a lot

3745
02:30:30,285 --> 02:30:31,860
of that deployed as well,

3746
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:33,240
and in fact, in

3747
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:35,430
the Enterprise Edge
as we call it,

3748
02:30:35,430 --> 02:30:39,630
across manufacturing,
retail, energy,

3749
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:41,160
health care,
this is already

3750
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:43,170
appearing in quite
a few areas.

3751
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:44,280
In fact, I think

3752
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,780
Dell has publicly
announced we have

3753
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:47,580
$6 billion worth
of business

3754
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:49,740
going into the far in
the near edge today

3755
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:52,680
with products that
were designed a while

3756
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:56,505
back and now are really
useful for Edge.

3757
02:30:56,505 --> 02:30:59,490
Then we have the near
Edge and think of this

3758
02:30:59,490 --> 02:31:00,600
as a small form factor

3759
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,220
datacenter and
then core cloud,

3760
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:03,420
everybody knows
what those are,

3761
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:05,145
so no need to
talk about them.

3762
02:31:05,145 --> 02:31:07,170
One thing that's
notable here is

3763
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:09,555
just like telecommunications
networks,

3764
02:31:09,555 --> 02:31:11,295
Edges will be nested.

3765
02:31:11,295 --> 02:31:15,690
So functional Edges will
tie to far Edges for

3766
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:18,390
support and then far Edges

3767
02:31:18,390 --> 02:31:19,635
will home to near Edges

3768
02:31:19,635 --> 02:31:20,910
for additional support,

3769
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:23,355
caching of data, other
types of functions.

3770
02:31:23,355 --> 02:31:25,440
So we expect to
see these to be

3771
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:28,470
architected in a way that

3772
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:30,930
they have a
progressive set of

3773
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:32,910
capabilities that one Edge

3774
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:34,080
can rely on another,

3775
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,510
just like telecom
networks do today.

3776
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:39,195
So Dell Technologies,
what are we doing?

3777
02:31:39,195 --> 02:31:41,910
So there's two
things on the side.

3778
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:43,830
So we're building a lot
of hardware platforms

3779
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:45,060
that are specific
for Edge and

3780
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:45,780
we've watched those are

3781
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:48,240
called Edge
Native portfolio.

3782
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,425
And then we're
working with

3783
02:31:49,425 --> 02:31:51,450
software ISVs to enable

3784
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:53,670
their capabilities
on our platforms

3785
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:55,470
and enable them to
operate in the Edge.

3786
02:31:55,470 --> 02:31:57,090
But the two that are
really important,

3787
02:31:57,090 --> 02:31:59,760
that are information
management

3788
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,365
related are the two
here in the middle.

3789
02:32:01,365 --> 02:32:03,840
So first of all,
private 5G and OpenRan,

3790
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:07,154
I talked about
mobility management

3791
02:32:07,154 --> 02:32:10,470
marks the capabilities
of how to tie that.

3792
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:12,360
We really need to
have solutions

3793
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:15,930
there for supporting 5G.

3794
02:32:15,930 --> 02:32:17,475
So we have an
entire division

3795
02:32:17,475 --> 02:32:18,780
called the
telecom solutions

3796
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,040
unit and they're building

3797
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:22,620
private 5G and open
ray and capabilities.

3798
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:24,270
But the relation to Edge

3799
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:26,010
is they provide
the ability to do

3800
02:32:26,010 --> 02:32:27,765
Wide Area service delivery

3801
02:32:27,765 --> 02:32:30,115
of Edge hosted
capabilities.

3802
02:32:30,115 --> 02:32:31,190
Think of the Edge as

3803
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:33,170
a service execution
environment

3804
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:35,480
where applications
and data are hosted.

3805
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,670
You can think of
the pirate 5G and

3806
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:39,230
the telecommunications
network as

3807
02:32:39,230 --> 02:32:41,410
a way to distribute
that capability.

3808
02:32:41,410 --> 02:32:42,780
And then we're building

3809
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:43,890
what we call a software

3810
02:32:43,890 --> 02:32:44,985
defined Edge or a

3811
02:32:44,985 --> 02:32:46,875
software operating
platform.

3812
02:32:46,875 --> 02:32:48,570
So you can think
of this as

3813
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:52,260
a Edge cloud that can
manage other Clouds and

3814
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:54,060
perform capabilities as

3815
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,950
a software platform
and we'll talk a

3816
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:57,720
little bit about that and
then we'll talk about

3817
02:32:57,720 --> 02:32:59,845
information management
relation to that.

3818
02:32:59,845 --> 02:33:02,120
So this is a diagram,

3819
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:03,590
some of this exists today.

3820
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:05,600
We are going to
launch very shortly

3821
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:06,860
our Edge software platform

3822
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:09,210
around the orchestration
exists today,

3823
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:10,740
our ability to
do application

3824
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:12,510
management exists today,

3825
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:16,560
our ability to do
security in hardware,

3826
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:17,745
onboarding and manage

3827
02:33:17,745 --> 02:33:19,965
execution environments
exist today.

3828
02:33:19,965 --> 02:33:21,450
Things we're looking at in

3829
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:23,550
the future, information
management,

3830
02:33:23,550 --> 02:33:25,230
which will be the
last slide and I

3831
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:27,570
specifically say
information management,

3832
02:33:27,570 --> 02:33:29,340
because we need
to start thinking

3833
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:30,960
about data and not as bits

3834
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:33,840
and bytes is the
quantification of

3835
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,310
information but
we've got to start

3836
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:37,050
thinking about
it semantically.

3837
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:39,375
What is this
objects intend?

3838
02:33:39,375 --> 02:33:41,010
Why is it being generated,

3839
02:33:41,010 --> 02:33:42,330
where is it destined for,

3840
02:33:42,330 --> 02:33:44,265
what are the
sensitivities about

3841
02:33:44,265 --> 02:33:45,960
handling and managing this

3842
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:47,595
as an object or a file.

3843
02:33:47,595 --> 02:33:49,440
We need to start
thinking about

3844
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:51,030
the data structures and

3845
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:53,595
what information they're
meant to convey.

3846
02:33:53,595 --> 02:33:56,910
Think of information
theory and Shannon bits,

3847
02:33:56,910 --> 02:34:00,240
or Hartley gnats that
really starts to become

3848
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,530
important to us in

3849
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:02,280
the future and I'll

3850
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,630
explain why in
the next slide.

3851
02:34:03,630 --> 02:34:04,920
We're also
looking at how we

3852
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:06,150
manage what we
call external

3853
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:07,680
services or
external service

3854
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:09,090
fabrics, which are clouds.

3855
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:11,310
It said CMAC so we can

3856
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:14,280
talk to white
area deliveries,

3857
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:16,560
I was talking in
telecommunications

3858
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,730
networks and then how

3859
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:21,270
do we create utilities
to manage devices.

3860
02:34:21,270 --> 02:34:22,950
So there's a lot
that's going in,

3861
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:24,210
it's a major
initiative for

3862
02:34:24,210 --> 02:34:25,860
Dell and we're
learning a lot.

3863
02:34:25,860 --> 02:34:28,530
We're learning
how to build

3864
02:34:28,530 --> 02:34:30,270
a distributed
system that can

3865
02:34:30,270 --> 02:34:32,550
host and manage
the applications,

3866
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:36,135
which is a very
interesting area

3867
02:34:36,135 --> 02:34:38,190
and quite as I
said before,

3868
02:34:38,190 --> 02:34:40,170
a lot of technical
challenges in terms

3869
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:42,315
of resource management
allocation,

3870
02:34:42,315 --> 02:34:44,250
in terms of information
management,

3871
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:45,780
in terms of how
do we maintain

3872
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:47,190
state on something that's

3873
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:48,795
impossible to
maintain state.

3874
02:34:48,795 --> 02:34:50,520
So how do we
build processes

3875
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:53,100
and orchestration
capabilities that

3876
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:54,960
will ensure that even

3877
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:57,555
if the system we
don't know the state,

3878
02:34:57,555 --> 02:34:59,220
we can still eventually

3879
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:01,320
reach an eventually
consistent state.

3880
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:03,810
So a lot of really
interesting and

3881
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:05,730
challenging problems
to solve there.

3882
02:35:05,730 --> 02:35:06,630
But let's talk about

3883
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:08,535
information management,
why we're here.

3884
02:35:08,535 --> 02:35:10,800
So one of the things,

3885
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:13,710
our journey in Edge
started back in

3886
02:35:13,710 --> 02:35:16,020
2017 and it started

3887
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:17,865
working with the
automotive industry.

3888
02:35:17,865 --> 02:35:19,950
And we believed
at the time,

3889
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:21,720
and I think that
our belief has

3890
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:23,790
been born out
that ultimately

3891
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:25,950
the automotive or
vehicular industry

3892
02:35:25,950 --> 02:35:28,110
is going to be a superset
of the challenges.

3893
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:29,640
The only one that's
close to it is

3894
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:32,115
public sector and
military applications,

3895
02:35:32,115 --> 02:35:34,530
they even have a
larger challenge

3896
02:35:34,530 --> 02:35:35,940
because they have
an adversarial

3897
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:37,050
issue to deal with,

3898
02:35:37,050 --> 02:35:38,520
as well as they
don't operate

3899
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,455
on road systems very much,

3900
02:35:40,455 --> 02:35:43,140
but very specialized in

3901
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,795
terms of its application
into enterprises.

3902
02:35:45,795 --> 02:35:47,970
So automotive is
the next best thing

3903
02:35:47,970 --> 02:35:49,410
because they're
going to be managing

3904
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:50,955
massive amounts of data.

3905
02:35:50,955 --> 02:35:54,750
They have to manage
extensive numbers

3906
02:35:54,750 --> 02:35:56,174
of AI workloads.

3907
02:35:56,174 --> 02:35:57,900
This is a year,
year-and-a-half old,

3908
02:35:57,900 --> 02:35:59,310
so I'm sure it's
changed now,

3909
02:35:59,310 --> 02:36:01,560
but Tesla had
published that they

3910
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:04,020
have over 60
models running in

3911
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:06,690
a Tesla today for
really what's Layer

3912
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:09,930
2 plus autonomy
in the vehicle.

3913
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:12,030
So it's really just
assisted driving,

3914
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:12,810
although it's so good,

3915
02:36:12,810 --> 02:36:15,300
it can give you the
impression that

3916
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:16,620
it's actually
really driving

3917
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:18,285
your vehicle
when it is not.

3918
02:36:18,285 --> 02:36:20,970
So, even that requires

3919
02:36:20,970 --> 02:36:22,530
around 60 different models

3920
02:36:22,530 --> 02:36:23,700
and different
types of models.

3921
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:24,930
It's got to run NLP,

3922
02:36:24,930 --> 02:36:27,285
it's got to run
capabilities

3923
02:36:27,285 --> 02:36:30,105
for the perception,

3924
02:36:30,105 --> 02:36:32,430
prediction, planning,
and control pipeline.

3925
02:36:32,430 --> 02:36:34,380
So lots of CNNs,

3926
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:36,689
it has to run
different capabilities

3927
02:36:36,689 --> 02:36:37,770
in terms of control.

3928
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:39,105
It has to run
autoencoders,

3929
02:36:39,105 --> 02:36:40,590
the list goes on
and on and on.

3930
02:36:40,590 --> 02:36:42,870
It touches a
wide variety of

3931
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:44,160
different neural networks

3932
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,930
and machine learning
technologies.

3933
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:47,250
So in any event, we

3934
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:48,840
started doing
research there,

3935
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:51,120
we quickly concluded
that there was

3936
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,430
going to need to be a
computational Edge that

3937
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:54,780
will manage the
communications

3938
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,830
environment and

3939
02:36:55,830 --> 02:37:01,710
manage the data associated
with all those AI.

3940
02:37:01,710 --> 02:37:03,090
One of the capabilities

3941
02:37:03,090 --> 02:37:04,320
that came to mind was

3942
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:07,050
NDN because it's a
distributed world.

3943
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:09,210
So on the production side,

3944
02:37:09,210 --> 02:37:11,010
we needed to identify

3945
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:12,945
data and that's
beyond NDN.

3946
02:37:12,945 --> 02:37:14,520
We needed to characterize

3947
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:16,170
semantically what
the data was

3948
02:37:16,170 --> 02:37:18,450
doing and we've done a
lot of work there with

3949
02:37:18,450 --> 02:37:20,970
various different
approaches and

3950
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:22,695
come up with some
really good ideas.

3951
02:37:22,695 --> 02:37:24,720
But then we needed
to advertise

3952
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:25,830
what that data was

3953
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:27,000
and expose it in

3954
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,920
a way that it
can be accessed.

3955
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:33,730
Once that
advertisement is done,

3956
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:39,000
as a service we can

3957
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,670
apply capabilities
like encryption or

3958
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:44,145
anonymization or
other functions

3959
02:37:44,145 --> 02:37:46,650
that need to be
done on the data,

3960
02:37:46,650 --> 02:37:47,850
given our government's

3961
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:49,440
policy around
the framework.

3962
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:51,120
Of course, we
needed to make sure

3963
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,650
we knew where this
data was coming from,

3964
02:37:52,650 --> 02:37:54,660
so we needed strong
provenance and we needed

3965
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,680
security to make sure

3966
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:57,315
that it's not been
tampered with.

3967
02:37:57,315 --> 02:37:59,040
Some of the
automotive folks,

3968
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,350
they have regulatory
requirements

3969
02:38:01,350 --> 02:38:03,945
that they have to keep
data for 15 years.

3970
02:38:03,945 --> 02:38:06,705
And so it's important
to make sure that it's

3971
02:38:06,705 --> 02:38:09,850
secure and that it's
not been tampered with.

3972
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:12,500
And then something I
call push movement.

3973
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:14,970
And what that
is, is we needed

3974
02:38:14,970 --> 02:38:17,265
to find a policy
around data movement.

3975
02:38:17,265 --> 02:38:19,590
If the data is too
large to move,

3976
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:21,630
either the networking
environment

3977
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:23,955
can't effectively
move the data.

3978
02:38:23,955 --> 02:38:25,290
It would take too long

3979
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:26,340
and it would
lose its value

3980
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:27,450
by the time we
got it moved

3981
02:38:27,450 --> 02:38:29,025
or it'd be too expensive,

3982
02:38:29,025 --> 02:38:31,560
can we apply a
compression service

3983
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:32,880
on it in a
different degrees,

3984
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:36,375
higher degrees of
compression in maybe apply

3985
02:38:36,375 --> 02:38:38,820
a lossless type
of compression

3986
02:38:38,820 --> 02:38:41,640
versus a lossy type
of compression?

3987
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,200
So these are
all the things

3988
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,580
we thought about
that needed to be

3989
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,605
done on the data
production side

3990
02:38:46,605 --> 02:38:49,470
and NDN fit the
bill very well.

3991
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:52,290
Highly scalable design for

3992
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:55,020
internet replacement of IP

3993
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:58,665
and Pub Sub based
subscription

3994
02:38:58,665 --> 02:39:00,060
so that we could

3995
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,295
create and maintain
consistency,

3996
02:39:02,295 --> 02:39:04,050
or we could choose
not to maintain

3997
02:39:04,050 --> 02:39:06,300
consistency and go
with availability.

3998
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,220
I'm sure this audience
is familiar with

3999
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:10,485
the CAP theorem from
Eric Brewer and Google.

4000
02:39:10,485 --> 02:39:12,240
So you can have
one or the other,

4001
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:13,755
you can't have both.

4002
02:39:13,755 --> 02:39:15,420
And that's now a theorem.

4003
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:18,285
So I believe it, there's
ways to minimize it,

4004
02:39:18,285 --> 02:39:21,345
but certain use
cases consistency,

4005
02:39:21,345 --> 02:39:24,030
making sure that I have
the absolute latest,

4006
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:26,280
greatest data that has

4007
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:27,870
the latest
modifications by

4008
02:39:27,870 --> 02:39:29,985
the producing workload
is very important.

4009
02:39:29,985 --> 02:39:32,400
Other use cases that's
not so important,

4010
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:34,035
so what's important
is having

4011
02:39:34,035 --> 02:39:35,910
the data available now.

4012
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:37,485
I need to make a decision.

4013
02:39:37,485 --> 02:39:39,225
I don't really care if
it's the latest stuff,

4014
02:39:39,225 --> 02:39:41,220
but I need to have it

4015
02:39:41,220 --> 02:39:42,960
highly available and I

4016
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:44,790
needed a very
short time frame.

4017
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:46,890
One of the things
we discovered was

4018
02:39:46,890 --> 02:39:49,620
that certain use
cases lean one way,

4019
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:51,420
certain use cases
lean the other.

4020
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:52,770
And we need a system that

4021
02:39:52,770 --> 02:39:54,615
can distinguish
between the two

4022
02:39:54,615 --> 02:39:57,090
and we think that
NDN presented

4023
02:39:57,090 --> 02:39:59,700
some opportunities in
that area to do that.

4024
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:02,835
Moving over to the
consumption side,

4025
02:40:02,835 --> 02:40:07,605
again, how do I get
access to the data?

4026
02:40:07,605 --> 02:40:10,500
NDN present some
real capabilities in

4027
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:13,095
terms of encoding
semantic location.

4028
02:40:13,095 --> 02:40:14,520
So data localization,

4029
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:15,630
so we know where
the data is

4030
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:18,510
at and that becomes
very important in Edge.

4031
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:21,090
Because today,

4032
02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:23,160
enterprise
applications and

4033
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:25,110
even non enterprise
applications,

4034
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:27,165
they work on two
fundamental assumptions.

4035
02:40:27,165 --> 02:40:29,685
The date is local or
the data is reachable,

4036
02:40:29,685 --> 02:40:32,895
and we believe as
Edges mature and

4037
02:40:32,895 --> 02:40:34,350
some of these
emerging use cases

4038
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:36,209
appear like multiverse,

4039
02:40:36,209 --> 02:40:38,220
like autonomous systems,

4040
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:40,650
and they really start
to be widely used,

4041
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:42,945
those two assumptions
are no longer valid.

4042
02:40:42,945 --> 02:40:44,760
The data could be remote,

4043
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,860
and it could be of size or

4044
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:49,500
sensitivity where it
cannot be easily moved.

4045
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:51,555
So we needed to bring in

4046
02:40:51,555 --> 02:40:54,075
a platform understanding
of the data,

4047
02:40:54,075 --> 02:40:55,620
and that becomes very

4048
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:57,195
important on the
consumption side.

4049
02:40:57,195 --> 02:40:59,070
We believe there are
other solutions on

4050
02:40:59,070 --> 02:41:00,525
the data production
side that

4051
02:41:00,525 --> 02:41:03,495
could work and be

4052
02:41:03,495 --> 02:41:06,300
implemented on the
data consumption side

4053
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:08,430
NDN even is more

4054
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:10,590
compelling because
we can take

4055
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:12,270
that policy and
we can make

4056
02:41:12,270 --> 02:41:14,070
decisions based
on network hops,

4057
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:15,690
the size of the data, etc.

4058
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:17,940
How do we give
that application

4059
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:19,170
access to the data?

4060
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:20,610
Do we provision it as

4061
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:23,460
a symbolic link or do
we do a network coded

4062
02:41:23,460 --> 02:41:25,680
file and only cash
a component or

4063
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:28,020
part of that data locally,

4064
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:29,160
and then we can
bring it in

4065
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:30,270
with network coding for

4066
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:31,590
multiple different
directions

4067
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:33,175
when the data is excess.

4068
02:41:33,175 --> 02:41:36,380
So that really covers
the first three data,

4069
02:41:36,380 --> 02:41:39,460
access, localization
and acquisition.

4070
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:43,515
But redirection, Pub
Sub for subscription.

4071
02:41:43,515 --> 02:41:46,380
How do we ensure that
the data has integrity,

4072
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:48,630
that it's signed
and authentic?

4073
02:41:48,630 --> 02:41:50,160
That all goes into

4074
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,635
the pole movement of
data consumption.

4075
02:41:52,635 --> 02:41:54,960
So a couple of things,

4076
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,430
you see my little
Kubernetes

4077
02:41:56,430 --> 02:41:57,180
in the middle there

4078
02:41:57,180 --> 02:41:59,460
and my little double
year orchestrator

4079
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:02,580
and my little
policy document

4080
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:04,530
with all the little
check marks on it,

4081
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:05,595
might be hard to

4082
02:42:05,595 --> 02:42:07,365
see for those of
you in the room.

4083
02:42:07,365 --> 02:42:09,540
But how can I

4084
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:12,120
interface this capability
to an orchestrator?

4085
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:13,170
So if I'm making

4086
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:14,430
any decisions or where

4087
02:42:14,430 --> 02:42:16,065
do I place applications,

4088
02:42:16,065 --> 02:42:16,950
and in the Edge,

4089
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:19,530
that's a very
complex equation.

4090
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:21,300
You've got to make
sure that you can

4091
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,430
allocate sufficient
resources for it to run.

4092
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:24,840
You've got to
make sure that

4093
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:26,190
the security
level is right.

4094
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:27,420
You've got to make
sure a lot of

4095
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:28,770
things that
aren't quite as

4096
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:30,015
important to do in Cloud

4097
02:42:30,015 --> 02:42:31,860
because of the
nature of Clouds,

4098
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:35,580
the highly elastic,
large resource pools.

4099
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:37,605
Clouds can do things after

4100
02:42:37,605 --> 02:42:39,240
applications
are deployed to

4101
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,920
optimize their execution.

4102
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:43,590
In Edge, you've
got a pre optimize

4103
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:46,680
and predict a lot
harder problem.

4104
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,660
So one of those issues

4105
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:50,490
is, where's the data at?

4106
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:52,140
So the orchestrator
can make

4107
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:54,000
a good decision on, okay,

4108
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:55,619
I can fit it here,

4109
02:42:55,619 --> 02:42:57,540
but my data may
not be available.

4110
02:42:57,540 --> 02:42:59,130
It may be over here. Can I

4111
02:42:59,130 --> 02:43:00,600
access that data remotely?

4112
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:02,610
Is the dataset small
enough and do I

4113
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:04,020
have enough networking
capability,

4114
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:04,890
can I do that?

4115
02:43:04,890 --> 02:43:06,960
So that's the whole
placement paradigm.

4116
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:08,760
How do I interface
this to something like

4117
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:11,190
a Kubernetes
orchestrator or

4118
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:13,230
other orchestration
frameworks we're using

4119
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:15,075
Kubernetes as well as

4120
02:43:15,075 --> 02:43:16,605
a building our
own orchestrator.

4121
02:43:16,605 --> 02:43:18,750
How do I handle this
placement decision?

4122
02:43:18,750 --> 02:43:20,310
Again, content management.

4123
02:43:20,310 --> 02:43:21,450
How do I make sure that

4124
02:43:21,450 --> 02:43:23,130
the data is governed
properly and then I'm

4125
02:43:23,130 --> 02:43:24,750
not violating any policy

4126
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:26,460
or governmental rule.

4127
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:28,020
And again, I've
already talked about

4128
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:31,005
availability, consistency,
and persistency.

4129
02:43:31,005 --> 02:43:32,940
So a lot of this
data, in fact,

4130
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:35,280
98% of the data
generated in

4131
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:36,720
an autonomous vehicle is

4132
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,565
never going to leave
the autonomous vehicle.

4133
02:43:38,565 --> 02:43:40,425
But the 2% that is,

4134
02:43:40,425 --> 02:43:42,420
is very important to
get that data off

4135
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:44,925
the vehicle into its
intended application.

4136
02:43:44,925 --> 02:43:47,700
So how do we persist
capabilities?

4137
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:49,665
How do we make sure
that that data that

4138
02:43:49,665 --> 02:43:52,200
is very important
to get to

4139
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:54,330
an application is
protected and has

4140
02:43:54,330 --> 02:43:58,515
the appropriate
governance around it

4141
02:43:58,515 --> 02:44:00,720
and geared in the
right way that

4142
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:02,940
it can only be accessed
by that application.

4143
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:05,595
Again, NDN can be
part of the answer.

4144
02:44:05,595 --> 02:44:08,640
So the reason I say
this is growing is

4145
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:12,640
because the Edge is
exploding a bit,

4146
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:15,989
we're very excited
about our platform.

4147
02:44:15,989 --> 02:44:17,985
It's already a large
business for Dell.

4148
02:44:17,985 --> 02:44:20,445
And we think it'll be
a lot larger business,

4149
02:44:20,445 --> 02:44:21,930
and Dell's not alone in

4150
02:44:21,930 --> 02:44:25,230
pursuing this space
it has becoming one

4151
02:44:25,230 --> 02:44:26,880
of the hottest topics

4152
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:30,750
really an IT/telecom
right now.

4153
02:44:30,750 --> 02:44:33,990
So it's a very
interesting space

4154
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:35,610
and this is going
to be one of

4155
02:44:35,610 --> 02:44:38,190
the top three
problems to solve is

4156
02:44:38,190 --> 02:44:40,230
this information
management

4157
02:44:40,230 --> 02:44:42,780
in data
mobility/management.

4158
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:45,150
So thanks for your time.

4159
02:44:45,150 --> 02:44:46,380
I don't know how
I'm doing on time.

4160
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:47,610
I think I'm
pretty close, but

4161
02:44:47,610 --> 02:44:49,605
any questions for me?

4162
02:44:49,605 --> 02:44:52,259
>> Let's thank the speaker

4163
02:44:52,259 --> 02:44:56,820
[APPLAUSE] So
we'll start with,

4164
02:44:56,820 --> 02:45:01,980
are there any
questions in the room?

4165
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:04,180
Any any questions online?

4166
02:45:05,330 --> 02:45:08,320
There's a question
in the room.

4167
02:45:09,950 --> 02:45:14,040
>> I'd be curious if
internal to Dell,

4168
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:16,125
NDN is seen as a
differentiator.

4169
02:45:16,125 --> 02:45:18,390
Are you using
it to enhance

4170
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:20,700
the competitive
position or is

4171
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:23,505
it purely a research
topic at this stage?

4172
02:45:23,505 --> 02:45:25,890
>> It's purely
research topic.

4173
02:45:25,890 --> 02:45:29,310
We actually built
some capabilities,

4174
02:45:29,310 --> 02:45:31,470
collaborated with low fee

4175
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:32,760
and the guys at NIST

4176
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:36,180
on using their high
performance folder

4177
02:45:36,180 --> 02:45:38,655
when we built a research
prototype around it.

4178
02:45:38,655 --> 02:45:41,670
This data
management problem,

4179
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:43,590
you need to understand

4180
02:45:43,590 --> 02:45:45,150
problems before you
can solve them,

4181
02:45:45,150 --> 02:45:46,650
and it's still
coming into focus.

4182
02:45:46,650 --> 02:45:47,820
So I don't think anyone

4183
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:49,110
has solved it as of yet.

4184
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:52,110
Most data services
are focused

4185
02:45:52,110 --> 02:45:53,190
on how to enable

4186
02:45:53,190 --> 02:45:55,350
application pipelines
around like email,

4187
02:45:55,350 --> 02:45:57,450
for instance, or how

4188
02:45:57,450 --> 02:45:59,835
to deliver
storage services.

4189
02:45:59,835 --> 02:46:01,260
Clouds are very good
at that. They've got

4190
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:03,825
a broad set of
capabilities.

4191
02:46:03,825 --> 02:46:05,520
So this problem really

4192
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:06,750
hasn't been tackled yet.

4193
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:08,490
So we're in the
process of trying to

4194
02:46:08,490 --> 02:46:11,790
decide what's the best
vehicle to tackle it.

4195
02:46:11,790 --> 02:46:14,175
We learned a lot from
our research prototype.

4196
02:46:14,175 --> 02:46:18,300
And I think I
had some points

4197
02:46:18,300 --> 02:46:20,430
and raised some commentary

4198
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:22,080
in the standardization
discussion.

4199
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,310
I think for NDN to

4200
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:26,220
really move into the
commercial realm,

4201
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:27,750
some of it has to
be standardized

4202
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:29,025
and adopted by

4203
02:46:29,025 --> 02:46:30,900
communities that are
going to ensure that

4204
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:33,510
the standardization
has a long lifetime.

4205
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:36,150
And I hope to see
that because I think

4206
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:39,090
NDN has solved a lot
of the problems,

4207
02:46:39,090 --> 02:46:40,575
the state vector sync,

4208
02:46:40,575 --> 02:46:42,840
and other
capabilities that

4209
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:45,780
we could leverage
in the Edge.

4210
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:48,120
One of the
challenges of Edge

4211
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:49,410
is that we can't consume

4212
02:46:49,410 --> 02:46:52,200
all the hardware
with our platform.

4213
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,450
So we have to have very
efficient execution

4214
02:46:54,450 --> 02:46:56,055
on the software side.

4215
02:46:56,055 --> 02:46:58,410
And I think NDN
can lend itself to

4216
02:46:58,410 --> 02:47:01,590
that because it's built
on high performance.

4217
02:47:01,590 --> 02:47:03,870
And with Ross coming

4218
02:47:03,870 --> 02:47:04,650
along and other things,

4219
02:47:04,650 --> 02:47:05,715
there's a lot
of capability.

4220
02:47:05,715 --> 02:47:07,305
So still a research
prototype.

4221
02:47:07,305 --> 02:47:09,000
We haven't made a
decision how to

4222
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,040
commercialize the
capability at all.

4223
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,800
But as we do, we'll
certainly consider NDN,

4224
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,540
and depending
on the maturity

4225
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:17,039
of the ecosystem,

4226
02:47:17,039 --> 02:47:18,675
it could definitely
be a choice for us.

4227
02:47:18,675 --> 02:47:19,110
>> Okay.

4228
02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:21,660
>> Yeah, I wanted
to comment because

4229
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:22,830
those two comments
you made in

4230
02:47:22,830 --> 02:47:25,230
the standardization
panel resonated with me,

4231
02:47:25,230 --> 02:47:28,410
that you need standards
of transport level of

4232
02:47:28,410 --> 02:47:30,030
the networking and also

4233
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:32,130
at the application API.

4234
02:47:32,130 --> 02:47:34,590
And it seems that
the Pub/Sub API is

4235
02:47:34,590 --> 02:47:35,670
meeting a lot of needs and

4236
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:37,560
that's our findings too.

4237
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:39,660
>> Yeah, and we found that

4238
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:42,090
in our prototyping
exercise,

4239
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:45,225
what Dr. Yi shared
earlier in this thing.

4240
02:47:45,225 --> 02:47:47,340
We've got to get
standardization.

4241
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:48,510
I can remember,

4242
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:49,620
and we don't have time for

4243
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:50,760
me to tell war stories,

4244
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:52,530
but we implemented layer

4245
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:54,330
2 tunneling protocol for

4246
02:47:54,330 --> 02:47:56,880
broadband access
in the late '90s,

4247
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:58,530
2000s timeframes.

4248
02:47:58,530 --> 02:47:59,820
And it wasn't quite

4249
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:01,200
standardized even
though there was

4250
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:05,595
an IETF paper out
on it in the RFC.

4251
02:48:05,595 --> 02:48:08,760
And I paid the price

4252
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:10,470
for deploying

4253
02:48:10,470 --> 02:48:12,570
a non-standard
capability in a network.

4254
02:48:12,570 --> 02:48:15,120
So you've really
got to have

4255
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:16,890
some degree of
interoperability

4256
02:48:16,890 --> 02:48:18,285
so when things don't work,

4257
02:48:18,285 --> 02:48:19,950
you can go back to

4258
02:48:19,950 --> 02:48:21,660
the standards
document and you can

4259
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:22,980
figure out the
most efficient,

4260
02:48:22,980 --> 02:48:24,585
most compliant way
to correct it.

4261
02:48:24,585 --> 02:48:27,300
And that's really
important.

4262
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:29,205
And then on the
application side,

4263
02:48:29,205 --> 02:48:31,725
the platforms can do
a lot of mediation.

4264
02:48:31,725 --> 02:48:33,090
So our goal was

4265
02:48:33,090 --> 02:48:34,155
the applications be

4266
02:48:34,155 --> 02:48:36,030
unaware of
what's going on.

4267
02:48:36,030 --> 02:48:37,740
Our goal is to create

4268
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:39,510
the environment that
applications think

4269
02:48:39,510 --> 02:48:41,160
they have in Cloud or

4270
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:43,410
in a datacenter
in the Edge.

4271
02:48:43,410 --> 02:48:44,730
So they don't know there's

4272
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:47,100
an underlying NDN
substrate that's

4273
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:48,750
moving data around and

4274
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:51,630
performing services
on the data.

4275
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:54,420
So we can create a
mediation layer,

4276
02:48:54,420 --> 02:48:56,370
but ultimately with
the capabilities

4277
02:48:56,370 --> 02:48:57,915
NDN brings to the table,

4278
02:48:57,915 --> 02:48:59,880
you want to be able to
expose it directly to

4279
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:00,960
the application so they

4280
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,610
can leverage it directly.

4281
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:06,000
And that's in some
ways a harder problem

4282
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,860
than telecommunications
network because

4283
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:09,345
you've got to get
adoption there.

4284
02:49:09,345 --> 02:49:12,240
It's not a standardized
capability.

4285
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:15,900
It's a way of
doing business,

4286
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:17,340
and that's why
Kubernetes did it and

4287
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,695
it's been fantastically
successful.

4288
02:49:19,695 --> 02:49:21,600
And you can run

4289
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,340
Kubernetes-based
applications.

4290
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:24,630
As long as it's
in a container,

4291
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:25,830
you can run them
on the Cloud,

4292
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:26,790
you can run them locally.

4293
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:28,410
It's across a variety of

4294
02:49:28,410 --> 02:49:29,460
different distributions

4295
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:30,660
and they almost
always work.

4296
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,920
It's absolutely

4297
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,570
amazing what
Google did there.

4298
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:35,640
And then the Cloud
native community

4299
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:36,840
afterward.

4300
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:40,260
>> Thank you, Jeff.
Interesting discussion.

4301
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:41,775
I think we tried
to take it

4302
02:49:41,775 --> 02:49:43,665
offline 45 minutes over.

4303
02:49:43,665 --> 02:49:44,610
So I appreciate your time.

4304
02:49:44,610 --> 02:49:46,020
Thank you, Jeff.

4305
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:48,090
Let's thank them
one more time.

4306
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:49,710
[APPLAUSE]

4307
02:49:49,710 --> 02:49:49,950
>> You're welcome.

4308
02:49:49,950 --> 02:49:52,410
>> Then our final talk

4309
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:56,670
is SPAN-AI
federated UCDN POC.

4310
02:49:56,670 --> 02:49:57,945
I don't know if I'm
saying that right.

4311
02:49:57,945 --> 02:50:00,390
First commercial ICN
network at scale

4312
02:50:00,390 --> 02:50:03,400
by Rhett Sampson
from GT Systems.

4313
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:06,620
Rhett is the founder
and CTO of GT Systems.

4314
02:50:06,620 --> 02:50:08,420
He's been designing,
building,

4315
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:10,880
and selling networks
globally for industry,

4316
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:12,200
government, defense and

4317
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:15,655
telcos for four decades.

4318
02:50:15,655 --> 02:50:17,820
Jamie, the coauthor,

4319
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:20,385
is GT Systems Head of R&D,

4320
02:50:20,385 --> 02:50:22,650
was a senior researcher
at Bell Labs in

4321
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:25,200
network optimization
for a decade,

4322
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:27,120
where he pioneered
the concept

4323
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:30,975
of software-defined
virtual CDN.

4324
02:50:30,975 --> 02:50:32,940
In his PhD work,

4325
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:35,640
he invented
physics-inspired graph

4326
02:50:35,640 --> 02:50:37,860
Edge Bayes Cloud network

4327
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:39,525
flow models to do that.

4328
02:50:39,525 --> 02:50:42,270
Rhett and Jamie are the
driving force behind

4329
02:50:42,270 --> 02:50:44,100
SPAN-AI and coauthors of

4330
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:45,690
several of its patents.

4331
02:50:45,690 --> 02:50:47,010
GT Systems is building

4332
02:50:47,010 --> 02:50:48,090
the world's first

4333
02:50:48,090 --> 02:50:50,280
commercial intelligent
information

4334
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,140
centric network at scale,

4335
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:54,390
is on their
SPAN-AI protocol

4336
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:56,590
and operating system.

4337
02:50:58,970 --> 02:51:02,170
>> Thanks very much.
Can you hear me?

4338
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:04,185
>> Yes.

4339
02:51:04,185 --> 02:51:05,460
>> Great. All right.

4340
02:51:05,460 --> 02:51:06,600
We're very
conscious that we

4341
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:07,470
stand between you and

4342
02:51:07,470 --> 02:51:08,850
your travel arrangements
to get home,

4343
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:10,470
so we'll try and

4344
02:51:10,470 --> 02:51:11,820
move through this
pretty quickly.

4345
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:13,590
Jeff, I don't know whether
you saw me nodding

4346
02:51:13,590 --> 02:51:15,300
my head off during
your presentation,

4347
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:18,120
but thank you for just
perfectly elucidating

4348
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:20,670
our business case
applications

4349
02:51:20,670 --> 02:51:22,005
for what we're doing.

4350
02:51:22,005 --> 02:51:25,000
And you didn't really
touch on it so much.

4351
02:51:25,610 --> 02:51:27,780
Yeah, you're going to love

4352
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:29,880
this presentation,
my friend.

4353
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:31,995
What we think is,

4354
02:51:31,995 --> 02:51:33,450
and where we
started in all of

4355
02:51:33,450 --> 02:51:35,760
this was video
distribution.

4356
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:37,470
So 80% of the internet,

4357
02:51:37,470 --> 02:51:39,960
it's a massive problem and

4358
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:42,360
it's what's broken
the Internet.

4359
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:43,845
So let's just get into it

4360
02:51:43,845 --> 02:51:46,450
and you'll see what
we're talking about.

4361
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:49,800
So it's a protocol and
an operating system.

4362
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:52,350
And the key piece
is this concept we

4363
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:53,700
have of a federated

4364
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:55,110
network of
intelligent networks.

4365
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:56,130
We all know the Internet

4366
02:51:56,130 --> 02:51:57,210
is a network of networks,

4367
02:51:57,210 --> 02:51:59,620
but to put it

4368
02:51:59,750 --> 02:52:02,565
bluntly there, it's
just done as a rock.

4369
02:52:02,565 --> 02:52:06,540
And so we are
pioneering the use

4370
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:07,980
of AI or machine

4371
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:10,830
learning in information
centric networking.

4372
02:52:10,830 --> 02:52:12,600
That's our stretch goal
down at the bottom.

4373
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:14,355
[LAUGHTER] We figured
once we've got that,

4374
02:52:14,355 --> 02:52:16,620
we might try on
something harder.

4375
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:18,930
What we have,
and I'm going

4376
02:52:18,930 --> 02:52:20,250
to move my little
thing here so I

4377
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:22,110
can actually read it
to the other side,

4378
02:52:22,110 --> 02:52:23,535
just bear with me.

4379
02:52:23,535 --> 02:52:25,590
So it's fully distributed,

4380
02:52:25,590 --> 02:52:27,090
content-based within

4381
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:28,770
network routing
and caching

4382
02:52:28,770 --> 02:52:30,900
with the AI inside

4383
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:32,940
the network at the
routing level.

4384
02:52:32,940 --> 02:52:35,070
And everyone's on
the same network.

4385
02:52:35,070 --> 02:52:36,690
You'll see a picture
later at the end

4386
02:52:36,690 --> 02:52:39,975
that still blows
my mind away.

4387
02:52:39,975 --> 02:52:42,630
That scales and
meets next-gen QoS.

4388
02:52:42,630 --> 02:52:44,280
Like I said,
pioneering the use of

4389
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:46,350
AI and Information
center networking.

4390
02:52:46,350 --> 02:52:49,830
I'll let Jamie talk about
the results we got.

4391
02:52:49,830 --> 02:52:51,510
We modeled this
on state of

4392
02:52:51,510 --> 02:52:53,160
the art models that Jamie

4393
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:54,180
developed and that's the

4394
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:55,440
result as you
can see there.

4395
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:56,100
Jamie, do you want to have

4396
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:58,330
a quick talk about this?

4397
02:52:58,430 --> 02:53:01,320
>> Yeah. Thank
you, Rhett. Yeah,

4398
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:03,495
just to comment on

4399
02:53:03,495 --> 02:53:05,100
these modelling
exercise that

4400
02:53:05,100 --> 02:53:06,480
we did with GT Systems is

4401
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:08,970
based on Cloud network
flow models that were

4402
02:53:08,970 --> 02:53:12,330
developed at Bell Labs
during my time there.

4403
02:53:12,330 --> 02:53:13,680
And those models
were developed

4404
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,630
with the vision
at that time

4405
02:53:15,630 --> 02:53:17,010
that the application
was getting

4406
02:53:17,010 --> 02:53:19,170
disaggregated and out
of the datacenters.

4407
02:53:19,170 --> 02:53:22,530
So as well as many
of you guys have

4408
02:53:22,530 --> 02:53:26,850
already encountered in
these NDN sessions.

4409
02:53:26,850 --> 02:53:28,515
In the end, that's
what's happening.

4410
02:53:28,515 --> 02:53:29,730
The application is getting

4411
02:53:29,730 --> 02:53:30,660
out of the datacenter,

4412
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:32,130
that is getting
desegregated,

4413
02:53:32,130 --> 02:53:34,470
the composable
applications and

4414
02:53:34,470 --> 02:53:36,150
they run in the network.

4415
02:53:36,150 --> 02:53:37,350
Essentially we say that

4416
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:39,450
the network becomes
the compute platform.

4417
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:41,250
So that edge in

4418
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:42,270
the premium real state

4419
02:53:42,270 --> 02:53:43,935
that telco operators own.

4420
02:53:43,935 --> 02:53:45,840
But in essence, any
resource that you can

4421
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:48,990
leverage to run
applications and host data.

4422
02:53:48,990 --> 02:53:50,670
Also, business logic

4423
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:53,100
and data get
disaggregated.

4424
02:53:53,100 --> 02:53:54,480
They live in the network.

4425
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:56,640
They move in the network

4426
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,665
is driven by
efficiency, ideally.

4427
02:53:58,665 --> 02:54:00,210
So with these models,

4428
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:02,550
what we do is we try
to look at what's

4429
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:04,980
the optimal
configuration when we

4430
02:54:04,980 --> 02:54:07,530
model an infrastructure
that has compute,

4431
02:54:07,530 --> 02:54:09,540
storage and
networking resources

4432
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:11,865
at different levels
from the device,

4433
02:54:11,865 --> 02:54:13,260
to the Edge, to

4434
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,495
the core, and
that continuum.

4435
02:54:15,495 --> 02:54:17,265
And then we model
applications as

4436
02:54:17,265 --> 02:54:19,200
flexible service
graphs composed

4437
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:23,025
of multiple functions,
live data sources,

4438
02:54:23,025 --> 02:54:24,780
static data sources and

4439
02:54:24,780 --> 02:54:26,385
functions that
are, in the end,

4440
02:54:26,385 --> 02:54:28,580
processing both live and

4441
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:29,630
static data sources

4442
02:54:29,630 --> 02:54:31,775
into consumable
experiences.

4443
02:54:31,775 --> 02:54:34,040
So when you describe

4444
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:34,940
well your set of

4445
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:36,500
applications and
the infrastructure,

4446
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:38,030
you optimize their
configuration

4447
02:54:38,030 --> 02:54:39,380
and you understand when it

4448
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:41,100
is actually efficient to

4449
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:42,510
move those applications
to the Edge.

4450
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:44,205
When things start
moving to the Edge,

4451
02:54:44,205 --> 02:54:46,305
what functions they are
moving to the Edge?

4452
02:54:46,305 --> 02:54:48,330
What contents start
moving to the Edge?

4453
02:54:48,330 --> 02:54:49,800
Then we see how as

4454
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:50,940
you increase
the data rate,

4455
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:52,350
the quality of the video.

4456
02:54:52,350 --> 02:54:54,270
Especially with low
latency applications,

4457
02:54:54,270 --> 02:54:55,560
you start seeing
more and more

4458
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:57,570
benefit of moving
to the Edge.

4459
02:54:57,570 --> 02:55:00,300
And that's only the
benefits of distribution.

4460
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:01,980
Then we add the
benefits of

4461
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:03,735
actually changing
the protocol.

4462
02:55:03,735 --> 02:55:05,910
So when things
leaving the network,

4463
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:07,170
when you have
multiple functions

4464
02:55:07,170 --> 02:55:08,415
and data that is moving,

4465
02:55:08,415 --> 02:55:09,870
and ideally you want

4466
02:55:09,870 --> 02:55:11,310
it to move and live
in the network,

4467
02:55:11,310 --> 02:55:13,650
you have a lot of space
for optimization.

4468
02:55:13,650 --> 02:55:15,645
What people don't
realize is that,

4469
02:55:15,645 --> 02:55:17,339
you can do a lot
with optimization

4470
02:55:17,339 --> 02:55:19,530
on a connection-oriented
architecture.

4471
02:55:19,530 --> 02:55:21,650
But if you remove that
constraint and you

4472
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:22,460
optimize now on

4473
02:55:22,460 --> 02:55:24,200
a connection-less
architecture,

4474
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:25,070
the benefits of

4475
02:55:25,070 --> 02:55:26,495
optimization are
even greater.

4476
02:55:26,495 --> 02:55:28,085
So you have more
granularity

4477
02:55:28,085 --> 02:55:29,660
for optimizing
the placement of

4478
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:31,970
these functions and data

4479
02:55:31,970 --> 02:55:34,290
and you get even
more benefits.

4480
02:55:34,290 --> 02:55:36,390
So that's the
exercise we did.

4481
02:55:36,390 --> 02:55:38,280
Try to understand in
different stages,

4482
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:40,365
what are the benefits of

4483
02:55:40,365 --> 02:55:43,065
using available
resources in the network

4484
02:55:43,065 --> 02:55:45,390
and change in also the
protocol that we use

4485
02:55:45,390 --> 02:55:48,720
to find content and
functions in the network.

4486
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:51,150
>> Thanks,
Jamie. And I was

4487
02:55:51,150 --> 02:55:52,200
pretty happy camper when

4488
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:53,190
those results came back.

4489
02:55:53,190 --> 02:55:54,450
We were hoping for
a good result,

4490
02:55:54,450 --> 02:55:56,130
but we were blown
away by it.

4491
02:55:56,130 --> 02:55:57,390
And really the good news

4492
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:58,275
now is we're going
to build it.

4493
02:55:58,275 --> 02:56:04,350
So that's even better
news. Why is mine.

4494
02:56:04,350 --> 02:56:07,425
That'll work. There
are the components.

4495
02:56:07,425 --> 02:56:10,320
We've got the
content-based protocol

4496
02:56:10,320 --> 02:56:12,270
and operating system,
which is span.

4497
02:56:12,270 --> 02:56:13,530
The span agents or the

4498
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:16,140
local autonomous
containerized agents.

4499
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:19,230
They're locally
optimizing.

4500
02:56:19,230 --> 02:56:21,870
SPAN-AI is doing

4501
02:56:21,870 --> 02:56:23,100
that local
optimization but

4502
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:24,990
also global optimization.

4503
02:56:24,990 --> 02:56:28,545
And then we use API in
the old-school sense,

4504
02:56:28,545 --> 02:56:29,700
like you, Jeff you've

4505
02:56:29,700 --> 02:56:31,230
been around for awhile.

4506
02:56:31,230 --> 02:56:33,210
This is basically so that

4507
02:56:33,210 --> 02:56:35,160
the intelligent
networks can

4508
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:36,195
talk to each other.

4509
02:56:36,195 --> 02:56:38,220
This is a bit
of a new thing.

4510
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:40,425
It's an AI API,

4511
02:56:40,425 --> 02:56:43,020
which will also
developing.

4512
02:56:43,020 --> 02:56:44,670
There's only really
three of them.

4513
02:56:44,670 --> 02:56:46,080
There's this,
the running API

4514
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,415
at the local level,

4515
02:56:47,415 --> 02:56:49,320
the operational API
at the local level,

4516
02:56:49,320 --> 02:56:50,880
and then the
global routing

4517
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:53,985
and optimizing AI.

4518
02:56:53,985 --> 02:56:56,175
So we federate
these networks

4519
02:56:56,175 --> 02:56:57,210
so they're built inside

4520
02:56:57,210 --> 02:56:58,680
the telco networks
at the edge,

4521
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:01,140
but also on the
datacenters,

4522
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:02,400
which you'll see
in a minute.

4523
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:03,900
Spanish DKA, which we're

4524
02:57:03,900 --> 02:57:05,190
going to give to the
likes of Disney and

4525
02:57:05,190 --> 02:57:07,440
paramount to
enable the client

4526
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:09,074
in their applications

4527
02:57:09,074 --> 02:57:10,440
to talk to the network,

4528
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:13,230
and then when you
federate all this,

4529
02:57:13,230 --> 02:57:13,740
it becomes

4530
02:57:13,740 --> 02:57:15,870
a universal distribution
that works.

4531
02:57:15,870 --> 02:57:18,000
This is the roadmap
we're doing proof of

4532
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,235
concepts were originally
in Australia.

4533
02:57:20,235 --> 02:57:22,485
They started with
laser-like communications,

4534
02:57:22,485 --> 02:57:23,865
global satellite,

4535
02:57:23,865 --> 02:57:26,400
laser background network
about a year ago.

4536
02:57:26,400 --> 02:57:28,410
It's now expanded wearing

4537
02:57:28,410 --> 02:57:30,360
a deep conversations
with Canada

4538
02:57:30,360 --> 02:57:32,265
about them
participating in this.

4539
02:57:32,265 --> 02:57:33,780
They've very advanced in

4540
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:34,830
their network into things

4541
02:57:34,830 --> 02:57:36,060
that they're doing,

4542
02:57:36,060 --> 02:57:37,650
and that will be signing

4543
02:57:37,650 --> 02:57:38,910
within Tilt to
Fino peoples,

4544
02:57:38,910 --> 02:57:40,860
which is X86 servers,

4545
02:57:40,860 --> 02:57:42,780
innocuous Linux
servers, routers,

4546
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:44,640
and video Bloomfield
trade APUs.

4547
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:46,140
These are our
starting platforms,

4548
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:47,550
but eventually we're
going to be on

4549
02:57:47,550 --> 02:57:50,620
everything and every
box in the network.

4550
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:55,560
We understand, as
everybody has said,

4551
02:57:55,560 --> 02:57:58,575
Jeff, we all know
this isn't finished.

4552
02:57:58,575 --> 02:58:01,230
There's some areas of
works to required.

4553
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:02,999
We're already been
talking to everybody.

4554
02:58:02,999 --> 02:58:05,640
They all know me by now.

4555
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:07,695
We're starting
to circulate

4556
02:58:07,695 --> 02:58:11,100
a discussion paper
around building,

4557
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:12,000
if you are like

4558
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,145
a cooperative
research group,

4559
02:58:14,145 --> 02:58:15,645
to plug the gaps

4560
02:58:15,645 --> 02:58:17,680
and then extend
the research.

4561
02:58:17,900 --> 02:58:19,470
By all means,

4562
02:58:19,470 --> 02:58:21,225
talk to me if
you're interested.

4563
02:58:21,225 --> 02:58:23,730
I could say attraction
with Bokeh Canada.

4564
02:58:23,730 --> 02:58:26,340
They have a lot of very
interesting friends,

4565
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:29,430
and we're getting
incredible engagement

4566
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:31,514
from the datacenters,
particularly,

4567
02:58:31,514 --> 02:58:32,730
we've had
conversations with

4568
02:58:32,730 --> 02:58:35,460
unit tests and Equinix,

4569
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:36,780
Bell Canada, as everyone

4570
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:38,190
probably may or
may not know,

4571
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:39,570
outsource their cord

4572
02:58:39,570 --> 02:58:40,980
data centers to
Equinix, or they've got

4573
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:42,930
a very close
relationship there,

4574
02:58:42,930 --> 02:58:44,280
and then a year ago

4575
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:45,810
we met Laser-Like
Communications,

4576
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:47,955
who are launching
medium-earth orbit

4577
02:58:47,955 --> 02:58:49,935
global laser satellites

4578
02:58:49,935 --> 02:58:51,450
with a big ground network,

4579
02:58:51,450 --> 02:58:52,500
and they've chosen us

4580
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:54,645
as the next-gen protocol.

4581
02:58:54,645 --> 02:58:57,420
The guys who were
at ACM, ICANN,

4582
02:58:57,420 --> 02:59:00,150
Asoka, will know
this picture.

4583
02:59:00,150 --> 02:59:02,160
I won't go into
detail on it.

4584
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:03,420
I assume the slides will

4585
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:04,695
be available to everybody.

4586
02:59:04,695 --> 02:59:05,280
But if you look at

4587
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:06,615
that picture
in the middle,

4588
02:59:06,615 --> 02:59:08,340
that's the one we
put up at a soccer,

4589
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:09,690
but it's actually changed.

4590
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:13,665
And it's changed
to this and

4591
02:59:13,665 --> 02:59:15,510
I still get
goosebumps when

4592
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:18,180
I say that because when

4593
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:22,060
99.9% sure that
top one is true,

4594
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:24,660
what we're gonna do

4595
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:28,020
is the way things
have gone,

4596
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:29,790
the centralization
with the hyperscalers,

4597
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:31,980
everyone is joining up
these datacenters on

4598
02:59:31,980 --> 02:59:35,715
massive bridged lands
using the excellent

4599
02:59:35,715 --> 02:59:37,680
and it's incredibly
complex and

4600
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:39,930
incredibly
inefficient so much

4601
02:59:39,930 --> 02:59:42,225
so that it requires
really complex orchester

4602
02:59:42,225 --> 02:59:44,760
to configure now
to the extent that

4603
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:47,400
they now need YAML
driven model AI to

4604
02:59:47,400 --> 02:59:50,430
do it and it's just
so inefficient.

4605
02:59:50,430 --> 02:59:52,275
We'd gone back to
the 1980s, I'm old,

4606
02:59:52,275 --> 02:59:54,450
but I remember bridged

4607
02:59:54,450 --> 02:59:57,584
Ethernet networks
with multiplexers.

4608
02:59:57,584 --> 02:59:59,850
That's really
what we're doing.

4609
02:59:59,850 --> 03:00:01,875
It's just crazy because

4610
03:00:01,875 --> 03:00:04,320
it's okay if you can
figure stuff upfront,

4611
03:00:04,320 --> 03:00:07,155
but if you decide, hey,

4612
03:00:07,155 --> 03:00:08,925
I want to access
to something

4613
03:00:08,925 --> 03:00:09,960
that I didn't know
about and you

4614
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:11,010
have to go all the
way up through

4615
03:00:11,010 --> 03:00:13,020
the VX lands and add
into IP to find where

4616
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:14,940
it is and you
come back and it

4617
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:16,050
could be in the right
next to you and

4618
03:00:16,050 --> 03:00:17,550
you just didn't even know.

4619
03:00:17,550 --> 03:00:19,275
That's in the datacenters

4620
03:00:19,275 --> 03:00:21,059
when you try to get
to the consumers

4621
03:00:21,059 --> 03:00:22,380
via IP and you bridge

4622
03:00:22,380 --> 03:00:24,510
these lands over
IP, it gets worse.

4623
03:00:24,510 --> 03:00:26,700
A lot of the customer

4624
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:29,385
access network
satellites 2.5,

4625
03:00:29,385 --> 03:00:30,720
so I need to tell

4626
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:33,270
you where
information centric.

4627
03:00:33,270 --> 03:00:35,580
So we're great
at layer two.

4628
03:00:35,580 --> 03:00:37,575
We can do last three
if we have two.

4629
03:00:37,575 --> 03:00:39,390
And basically
it's as simple

4630
03:00:39,390 --> 03:00:41,175
as this join up
the data centers,

4631
03:00:41,175 --> 03:00:42,780
put information

4632
03:00:42,780 --> 03:00:44,670
centric networking
on the network.

4633
03:00:44,670 --> 03:00:46,710
Job done. That's what

4634
03:00:46,710 --> 03:00:47,865
we're doing with
building it.

4635
03:00:47,865 --> 03:00:50,130
We're doing a big rise
at about the middle of

4636
03:00:50,130 --> 03:00:52,080
the year to build

4637
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:53,760
this, we're going
to code it.

4638
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:56,579
We figured we'll have
a demonstration.

4639
03:00:56,579 --> 03:00:57,870
We've also building
a distributed

4640
03:00:57,870 --> 03:00:58,890
origins store and I

4641
03:00:58,890 --> 03:01:00,480
mean really
distributed like

4642
03:01:00,480 --> 03:01:01,980
way out at the edge,

4643
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:03,450
like no one has
done before.

4644
03:01:03,450 --> 03:01:05,970
Now the data centers

4645
03:01:05,970 --> 03:01:07,110
at the top of our network.

4646
03:01:07,110 --> 03:01:08,970
The bottom of
our network is,

4647
03:01:08,970 --> 03:01:10,560
thanks for some new words.

4648
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:12,180
By the way, Jeff,
extreme edge and

4649
03:01:12,180 --> 03:01:14,025
whatever else
came after that.

4650
03:01:14,025 --> 03:01:15,420
We didn't even know
about that one.

4651
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:16,650
But we agree with
you and I we

4652
03:01:16,650 --> 03:01:18,180
totally agree with
you to get this done,

4653
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:18,960
there's only
one way you're

4654
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:19,785
going to do it and it's

4655
03:01:19,785 --> 03:01:21,210
that picture and you

4656
03:01:21,210 --> 03:01:22,335
need a protocol to do it.

4657
03:01:22,335 --> 03:01:23,400
And that's what
we're building,

4658
03:01:23,400 --> 03:01:24,600
and we're going
to do, as I said,

4659
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:26,440
a very big rise

4660
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:29,105
out of the West
Coast mayhem here.

4661
03:01:29,105 --> 03:01:30,800
We're already talking
to some East Coast

4662
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:32,360
TMT guys have said
they want to be

4663
03:01:32,360 --> 03:01:34,010
next and it's getting

4664
03:01:34,010 --> 03:01:36,695
really, really
interesting.

4665
03:01:36,695 --> 03:01:40,560
That's it. Thank
you. Questions.

4666
03:01:40,570 --> 03:01:44,940
>> Thanks for Speaker.
First I want to say,

4667
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:47,880
I apologize for screwing
up your name Haimy.

4668
03:01:47,880 --> 03:01:50,985
I'm a victim of that
myself, so I apologize.

4669
03:01:50,985 --> 03:01:51,780
Let's see.

4670
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:54,730
Are there any
questions in the room?

4671
03:01:56,720 --> 03:02:00,165
>> Yeah. That happens
because quiet.

4672
03:02:00,165 --> 03:02:01,500
It's a lot to get
your head around.

4673
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:07,030
>> Are there any
questions online?

4674
03:02:08,330 --> 03:02:10,500
I don't see anything
in the chat,

4675
03:02:10,500 --> 03:02:12,930
so I have a question
regarding this.

4676
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:14,820
So articulate it a little

4677
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:17,700
bit the role of
MDMU where that,

4678
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:19,470
where it could play in

4679
03:02:19,470 --> 03:02:21,195
your vision of the future.

4680
03:02:21,195 --> 03:02:22,920
Have you prototyped
any of that at

4681
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:25,935
this point or is it
still just a vision?

4682
03:02:25,935 --> 03:02:27,810
>> We've modeled it, but

4683
03:02:27,810 --> 03:02:28,800
let me give you
the vision.

4684
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:29,640
It's really simple.

4685
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:31,050
So we set out
ten years ago,

4686
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:33,270
we brought a technology

4687
03:02:33,270 --> 03:02:34,980
to Australia called
manufacturer on-demand.

4688
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:37,410
We're burning CDs and
DVDs and retail stores,

4689
03:02:37,410 --> 03:02:38,940
working with all
the studios.

4690
03:02:38,940 --> 03:02:40,620
And we had a retailer, and

4691
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:42,420
see biggest retailer in

4692
03:02:42,420 --> 03:02:43,365
Australia, by the way.

4693
03:02:43,365 --> 03:02:45,150
And he said I want to
do online and I said,

4694
03:02:45,150 --> 03:02:46,080
so don't go
anywhere I give you

4695
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:47,040
a couple of
months and then I

4696
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:48,960
went away to research
how to do it.

4697
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:49,500
And I found about

4698
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:51,150
the single
adaptive bit rate,

4699
03:02:51,150 --> 03:02:55,110
which causes the
spinning wheel of death

4700
03:02:55,110 --> 03:02:56,805
and steals your money

4701
03:02:56,805 --> 03:02:58,020
because you're not
getting what you

4702
03:02:58,020 --> 03:02:59,160
paid for and
only went well,

4703
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:01,080
that sucks and
then set up,

4704
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:02,610
set out to find a
better solution.

4705
03:03:02,610 --> 03:03:05,070
And the better solution is

4706
03:03:05,070 --> 03:03:08,100
really a combination
of brand cones,

4707
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:10,169
BitTorrent, which is
a genius protocol.

4708
03:03:10,169 --> 03:03:11,460
Some of the stuff that

4709
03:03:11,460 --> 03:03:13,740
Michelle was
talking about.

4710
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:16,620
Basically the
concept is very

4711
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,880
simple and you
will recognize

4712
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:19,170
this as soon as I said,

4713
03:03:19,170 --> 03:03:20,790
we came up with the idea

4714
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:22,260
of slicing the video,

4715
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:24,960
which we do
already, tagging

4716
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:27,465
it and in the words
of the pattern,

4717
03:03:27,465 --> 03:03:29,160
Recording word for word,

4718
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:30,885
tagging it with a hash or

4719
03:03:30,885 --> 03:03:33,165
some other efficient
database mechanism.

4720
03:03:33,165 --> 03:03:35,880
I eat a name we didn't
know about names that

4721
03:03:35,880 --> 03:03:37,530
stage and then moving

4722
03:03:37,530 --> 03:03:40,200
those bits around
intelligently.

4723
03:03:40,200 --> 03:03:42,495
That was another keyword.

4724
03:03:42,495 --> 03:03:44,745
That's it. That's
the core concept.

4725
03:03:44,745 --> 03:03:46,500
That is information
centric networking.

4726
03:03:46,500 --> 03:03:48,300
But ten years
ago, we didn't

4727
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:50,865
know what information
centric networking was.

4728
03:03:50,865 --> 03:03:52,620
Then it only just come up

4729
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:54,015
with the idea back then.

4730
03:03:54,015 --> 03:03:55,455
We were working
in parallel.

4731
03:03:55,455 --> 03:03:57,450
So we've discovered IPFS,

4732
03:03:57,450 --> 03:03:58,830
we thought that was great.

4733
03:03:58,830 --> 03:04:00,150
We tried to help them

4734
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:01,230
with some scaling issues.

4735
03:04:01,230 --> 03:04:02,400
They've got a bit of

4736
03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:05,040
a black hole so we've
moved on from there.

4737
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:07,470
But information centric
networking we love,

4738
03:04:07,470 --> 03:04:09,780
and that's really
the design we have.

4739
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:11,760
And it's

4740
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:14,430
just that fundamental
change when you go from

4741
03:04:14,430 --> 03:04:16,110
the connection-oriented
DOM bits

4742
03:04:16,110 --> 03:04:17,055
down a pipe to

4743
03:04:17,055 --> 03:04:19,200
connection was talking

4744
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:20,700
about the actual content.

4745
03:04:20,700 --> 03:04:22,050
It just changes
everything and

4746
03:04:22,050 --> 03:04:23,220
it's become a journey of

4747
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:26,475
discovery as to really
how much it changes.

4748
03:04:26,475 --> 03:04:27,510
Because the last couple of

4749
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:28,665
days, I've been saying

4750
03:04:28,665 --> 03:04:29,790
quietly under my breath

4751
03:04:29,790 --> 03:04:31,275
in the middle of the
night in Australia,

4752
03:04:31,275 --> 03:04:32,880
you guys have no idea

4753
03:04:32,880 --> 03:04:33,780
what you've got hold on.

4754
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:35,940
We've got hold of
the tail of a tiger.

4755
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:37,170
Jeff, I think you

4756
03:04:37,170 --> 03:04:38,310
would agree with
me on this.

4757
03:04:38,310 --> 03:04:41,715
This is going to be

4758
03:04:41,715 --> 03:04:44,910
huge and we're
going to build up.

4759
03:04:44,910 --> 03:04:46,410
>> I think everybody talks

4760
03:04:46,410 --> 03:04:48,090
about in terms of edge.

4761
03:04:48,090 --> 03:04:49,710
It's all about latency

4762
03:04:49,710 --> 03:04:51,419
and independent operation

4763
03:04:51,419 --> 03:04:52,500
and all but

4764
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:57,660
soon they're going to
figure within months,

4765
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:59,910
two years, so two
to three years,

4766
03:04:59,910 --> 03:05:01,020
they're going to
start talking

4767
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:02,760
about how do I have to

4768
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:04,320
manage that data remotely

4769
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:05,580
and how do I
make it happen,

4770
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:08,190
and it's only the folks

4771
03:05:08,190 --> 03:05:10,860
that are really
active in Edge that

4772
03:05:10,860 --> 03:05:12,270
are already having a lot

4773
03:05:12,270 --> 03:05:13,530
of their systems deployed

4774
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:16,470
into Edge that are aware
of this problem in,

4775
03:05:16,470 --> 03:05:18,030
so we're the ones
talking about

4776
03:05:18,030 --> 03:05:19,410
it because we're already

4777
03:05:19,410 --> 03:05:20,940
having to work
with customers to

4778
03:05:20,940 --> 03:05:22,800
try to figure out how
to solve this problem.

4779
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:24,480
It's very exactly.

4780
03:05:24,480 --> 03:05:26,895
>> I'm in the middle
of a discussion

4781
03:05:26,895 --> 03:05:28,320
on LinkedIn at the moment

4782
03:05:28,320 --> 03:05:30,390
about the problem is

4783
03:05:30,390 --> 03:05:32,385
that once people
start to wake up,

4784
03:05:32,385 --> 03:05:33,600
everyone wants to push

4785
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:34,635
to the edge so
you just want to.

4786
03:05:34,635 --> 03:05:35,445
Video,

4787
03:05:35,445 --> 03:05:37,160
Netflix they've got
their own network,

4788
03:05:37,160 --> 03:05:38,930
the tribe try and
push out Akamai,

4789
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:39,950
I've got their network,

4790
03:05:39,950 --> 03:05:41,750
all of the other
CDNs have got this.

4791
03:05:41,750 --> 03:05:44,210
Now Azure and AWS

4792
03:05:44,210 --> 03:05:46,250
are trying to push
out to the edge.

4793
03:05:46,250 --> 03:05:48,455
That's Toko, golden
real estate.

4794
03:05:48,455 --> 03:05:49,955
They all want it for free.

4795
03:05:49,955 --> 03:05:52,040
Netflix want their
stuff carried for free,

4796
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:53,240
and they all want
to be there.

4797
03:05:53,240 --> 03:05:55,635
There's this simple
fundamental problem.

4798
03:05:55,635 --> 03:05:57,085
They can't all be there.

4799
03:05:57,085 --> 03:05:58,925
So we're going
to have to have

4800
03:05:58,925 --> 03:06:01,670
some virtualized
content-based service

4801
03:06:01,670 --> 03:06:02,870
that allows everyone to

4802
03:06:02,870 --> 03:06:04,355
run a service at the edge,

4803
03:06:04,355 --> 03:06:06,590
but you don't
have to be there.

4804
03:06:06,590 --> 03:06:09,200
>> Thanks. I appreciate
the perspective,

4805
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:11,900
the future is bright.
Thank you, gentlemen.

4806
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:13,850
>> The future is huge.

4807
03:06:13,850 --> 03:06:16,220
>> Back to you Letif
for closing remarks.

4808
03:06:16,220 --> 03:06:16,970
Thank you.

4809
03:06:16,970 --> 03:06:19,325
>> Alright. Thank
you very much.

4810
03:06:19,325 --> 03:06:21,500
I think this concludes

4811
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:25,090
our program right on time.

4812
03:06:25,090 --> 03:06:27,615
Thank you all
for attending

4813
03:06:27,615 --> 03:06:30,105
and the income 23.

4814
03:06:30,105 --> 03:06:33,270
Thank you to all
the presenters,

4815
03:06:33,270 --> 03:06:35,624
the panelists
and the chairs,

4816
03:06:35,624 --> 03:06:39,400
or the panel chairs
and the sessions here.

4817
03:06:40,370 --> 03:06:43,200
I think we had very
interesting discussions

4818
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:44,580
and new ideas that
this meeting,

4819
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:48,120
and hopefully we
should be able to do

4820
03:06:48,120 --> 03:06:50,220
some new work
and report on it

4821
03:06:50,220 --> 03:06:53,175
during the next Andean
community meeting.

4822
03:06:53,175 --> 03:06:55,500
So thanks again, everyone,

4823
