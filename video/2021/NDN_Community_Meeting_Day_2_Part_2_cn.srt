1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,930
>> Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,015
In this session, we have

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:09,520
a panel on NDN's accessibility.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,605
This is more of an informal panel,

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,940
so we don't have slides,

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,455
we are going to go around,

7
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:19,935
talk about what it means to be accessible,

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:21,000
what are the challenges

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,620
and how we can solve this.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,150
For the panelists, we

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,835
have Alex from Clemson,

12
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:31,365
James from Air Force Research Lab, Christos,

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,060
University of Memphis,

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,675
Matthias from Berlin,

15
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,565
and then make Beichuan from

16
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:41,110
University of Arizona.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,640
Welcome to the panel. Maybe we

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,975
can go around and

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:50,940
introduce ourselves to the audience.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,020
Alex, you want to go first?

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,340
>> Yeah, sure. I'm, Alex Feltus.

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm a professor at Clemson University

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,550
in the Department of Genetics

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,440
and Biochemistry.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,035
I'm not network engineer.

26
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,000
We study plants and animals.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,900
I just had a lab meeting

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,530
where we were talking

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,830
about how bean plants fix nitrogen

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,350
from the air and how

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,480
bone wasting disease might

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,910
be occurring genetically,

33
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,460
and also, we talked about how we can estimate

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,320
Cloud resource usage if we're to

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,045
run our workflows in the same lab meeting.

36
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:31,475
We're using NDN to try to aggregate data,

37
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,840
make a data lake to be able

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,970
to access all the genomes that had

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,740
been sequenced for anybody

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,920
that does any real Biology,

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,070
a lot of people use these datasets now.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,140
>> Beichuan.

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,635
>> Hi, can you hear me okay?

44
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,270
>> Yes, we can hear you.

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,015
>> Thanks. I'm doing several mic checks.

46
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,485
I'm James Lyke,

47
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm with the Air Force

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,030
Research Laboratory and I

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,120
work in Space Vehicle Development.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,685
I'm very interested in

51
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:12,275
networking in a global sense

52
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,185
or spacecraft play a role in

53
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:19,175
facilitating the network connectivity.

54
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:23,540
I also have an adjunct professor

55
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,535
at the University in Mexico,

56
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:28,410
that's actually where I'm sitting today.

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,585
I think the interest we have in NDN is

58
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:37,190
using it in some way to help

59
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,135
facilitate an improvement in connectivity.

60
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:43,925
I think in some sense it has

61
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,890
interesting features

62
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,620
that we wanted to exploit.

63
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,350
I'm interested in more pervasive uses

64
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,170
in Department of Defense,

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,275
but then we have

66
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,350
also experienced some significant barriers.

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,240
I think it's that ossification that we hear

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,460
about with Internet technologies,

69
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,510
Internet protocols,

70
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,800
and some of those barriers are very

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
difficult and so in

72
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,985
research trying to figure out ways

73
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:14,540
to make the benefits of

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,860
NDN more accessible, more understood. Thanks.

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,700
>> Thank you. Beichuan,

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,720
do you want to go next?

77
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,445
>> Yeah, my name's Beichuan Zhang.

78
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,310
I'm a Professor of

79
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,945
Neuroscience Department,

80
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:38,170
University of Arizona.

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,310
I am a network researcher.

82
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,140
I have been working on NDN for last decade.

83
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,075
I'm not really a real-world user

84
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,880
of NDN for this panel,

85
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,800
but I can talk about

86
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
my group experience of

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
developing some applications

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,640
and the accessibility issues we ran

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,680
into and effort we're

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,300
trying to solve those issues,

91
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,540
but still they solve a problem,

92
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,180
so also very interesting.

93
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,280
Let's hear what other people

94
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,780
on this panel will say about that.

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,845
>> Thank you. Christos.

96
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,470
>> I'm Christos Papadopoulos,

97
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,190
I'm a professor at the University of Memphis,

98
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,170
also in Computer Science and

99
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,445
my background is also

100
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,215
networking like Beichuan.

101
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,090
I have been with the NDN

102
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,855
team since the beginning.

103
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,870
I spent a couple of years at

104
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,085
the HS as a program manager,

105
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,120
and that is where I got exposed

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,730
to things such as legal cybersecurity,

107
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,670
which I found really interesting,

108
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,450
and my interest after

109
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,390
that is seeing how to apply NDN

110
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,270
into legal communication and more

111
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,320
broadly into

112
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,510
the transportation infrastructure. Thanks.

113
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,615
>> Thank you, Christos. Matthias.
