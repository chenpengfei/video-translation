1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,930
>> Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,015
In this session, we have

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:09,520
a panel on NDN's
accessibility.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,605
This is more of an
informal panel,

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,940
so we don't have slides,

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,455
we are going to go around,

7
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:19,935
talk about what it
means to be accessible,

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:21,000
what are the challenges

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,620
and how we can solve this.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,150
For the panelists, we

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,835
have Alex from Clemson,

12
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:31,365
James from Air Force
Research Lab, Christos,

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,060
University of Memphis,

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,675
Matthias from Berlin,

15
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,565
and then make
Beichuan from

16
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:41,110
University of Arizona.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,640
Welcome to the
panel. Maybe we

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,975
can go around and

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:50,940
introduce ourselves
to the audience.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,020
Alex, you want
to go first?

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,340
>> Yeah, sure.
I'm, Alex Feltus.

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm a professor at
Clemson University

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,550
in the Department
of Genetics

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,440
and Biochemistry.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,035
I'm not network engineer.

26
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,000
We study plants
and animals.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,900
I just had a lab meeting

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,530
where we were talking

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,830
about how bean
plants fix nitrogen

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,350
from the air and how

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,480
bone wasting disease might

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,910
be occurring genetically,

33
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,460
and also, we talked about
how we can estimate

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,320
Cloud resource
usage if we're to

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,045
run our workflows in
the same lab meeting.

36
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:31,475
We're using NDN to try
to aggregate data,

37
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,840
make a data
lake to be able

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,970
to access all the
genomes that had

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,740
been sequenced for anybody

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,920
that does any
real Biology,

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,070
a lot of people use
these datasets now.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,140
>> Beichuan.

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,635
>> Hi, can you
hear me okay?

44
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,270
>> Yes, we can hear you.

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,015
>> Thanks. I'm doing
several mic checks.

46
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,485
I'm James Lyke,

47
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm with the Air Force

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,030
Research Laboratory and I

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,120
work in Space
Vehicle Development.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,685
I'm very interested in

51
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:12,275
networking in
a global sense

52
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,185
or spacecraft
play a role in

53
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:19,175
facilitating the
network connectivity.

54
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:23,540
I also have an
adjunct professor

55
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,535
at the University
in Mexico,

56
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:28,410
that's actually where
I'm sitting today.

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,585
I think the interest
we have in NDN is

58
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:37,190
using it in some
way to help

59
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,135
facilitate an improvement
in connectivity.

60
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:43,925
I think in some
sense it has

61
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,890
interesting features

62
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,620
that we wanted to exploit.

63
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,350
I'm interested in
more pervasive uses

64
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,170
in Department of Defense,

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,275
but then we have

66
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,350
also experienced some
significant barriers.

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,240
I think it's that
ossification that we hear

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,460
about with Internet
technologies,

69
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,510
Internet protocols,

70
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,800
and some of those
barriers are very

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
difficult and so in

72
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,985
research trying to
figure out ways

73
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:14,540
to make the benefits of

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,860
NDN more accessible,
more understood. Thanks.

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,700
>> Thank you. Beichuan,

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,720
do you want to go next?

77
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,445
>> Yeah, my name's
Beichuan Zhang.

78
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,310
I'm a Professor of

79
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,945
Neuroscience Department,

80
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:38,170
University of Arizona.

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,310
I am a network researcher.

82
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,140
I have been working on
NDN for last decade.

83
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,075
I'm not really a
real-world user

84
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,880
of NDN for this panel,

85
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,800
but I can talk about

86
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
my group experience of

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
developing some
applications

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,640
and the accessibility
issues we ran

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,680
into and effort we're

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,300
trying to solve
those issues,

91
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,540
but still they
solve a problem,

92
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,180
so also very interesting.

93
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,280
Let's hear what
other people

94
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,780
on this panel will
say about that.

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,845
>> Thank you. Christos.

96
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,470
>> I'm Christos
Papadopoulos,

97
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,190
I'm a professor at the
University of Memphis,

98
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,170
also in Computer
Science and

99
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,445
my background is also

100
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,215
networking like Beichuan.

101
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,090
I have been with the NDN

102
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,855
team since the beginning.

103
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,870
I spent a couple
of years at

104
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,085
the HS as a
program manager,

105
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,120
and that is where
I got exposed

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,730
to things such as
legal cybersecurity,

107
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,670
which I found
really interesting,

108
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,450
and my interest after

109
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,390
that is seeing
how to apply NDN

110
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,270
into legal
communication and more

111
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,320
broadly into

112
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,510
the transportation
infrastructure. Thanks.

113
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,615
>> Thank you,
Christos. Matthias.

114
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,805
>> Hello, my
name is Matthias

115
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,725
from F. Berlin.

116
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm an Assistant
Professor heading

117
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,460
the Internet technologies
research group.

118
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,155
One of my research is
Internet of Things,

119
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:22,340
and this is one use
case that we try to

120
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,035
exploit for NDN
and IC in general.

121
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,710
I'm not only
doing research,

122
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm also involved in
open source communities.

123
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,910
I'm also the co-founder of

124
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,335
RIOT operating system,

125
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,120
an open-source
operating system

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,160
for constraint
IoT devices.

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,850
This is where we
try to exploit

128
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,590
the benefits of NDN by

129
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,870
segment resources such
as battery power,

130
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,280
increased scalability

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,295
and and loss in networks.

132
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:52,770
>> Great, thank you.
I think we will have

133
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,990
a few diverse
applications as from

134
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,065
genomics and then
space and IoT.

135
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,950
I think that accessibility

136
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,970
challenges are going to

137
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,460
be different for this.

138
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,270
Maybe the panelists can

139
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,680
talk a little bit about

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,975
what were the challenges

141
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,095
that you faced when
you tried to use NDN.

142
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,705
Is it backup
documentation,

143
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,745
lack of customer
applications,

144
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:24,430
is it lack of
quantifiability?

145
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,240
Matthias, you
mentioned IoT,

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,770
maybe what are
the challenges

147
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,200
in using NDN for IoT?

148
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,225
>> From a software
point of view,

149
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:47,655
actually I do not see

150
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:51,450
much challenges from
the NDN companies.

151
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,495
It is well-documented,

152
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:56,335
the maintainers are
easily approachable.

153
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:58,000
It's definitely
a challenge from

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,970
a systems
perspective to bring

155
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,160
NDN's deck to
constraint devices,

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,380
but it's doable.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,760
From this point of view,

158
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,035
I do not see
much challenges

159
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:15,050
even for our
research purposes.

160
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,430
in the end, I see

161
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,580
endish approaches
in larger testbeds.

162
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,780
Where maybe I
see a challenge,

163
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,630
is these testbeds,

164
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,220
is some more little
bit constrained,

165
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,725
confined
environments to have

166
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:36,040
actually easily
accessible testbeds

167
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,580
that spends several
universities and

168
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,770
they have in the
real inter-domain

169
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,405
type of connectivity.

170
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,285
This is something
that I actually miss.

171
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,885
The other thing
that I miss is

172
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:54,910
perspectives on
a global level,

173
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,420
global approach in the
sense, for example,

174
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,335
that there's not much
thought and effort in,

175
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:04,060
for example, how to

176
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,995
manage the
namespace in NDN,

177
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:08,350
and this is
independent of IoT.

178
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,200
But I think a very
crucial aspects

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,970
that we have a lot of

180
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,680
interesting and
challenging research

181
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,015
questions that
you all tackled,

182
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,000
but we somehow miss the
operational aspects,

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,915
and so that is how we

184
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,165
manage the
namespace in case

185
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:28,150
of NDN gets globally used.

186
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,130
>> There is the
challenge then

187
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,050
in deploying NDN

188
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,955
rather than using NDN
in a small-scale.

189
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:40,030
>> I mean, it's
definitely a challenge.

190
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,740
It is always a
challenge to get

191
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,235
a new protocol and
architecture deployed.

192
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:48,550
>> No, even within this
research community,

193
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:56,795
not in the
internet per se.

194
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:58,090
>> No. I mean using

195
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,290
NDN in the research
environment.

196
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,610
I don't think it's a
challenge actually,

197
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,860
it is straightforward
and useable.

198
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,810
>> When you say
global approach,

199
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,315
you mean the actual
commercial intranet.

200
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:11,455
>> Right. Getting
NDN out of the lab,

201
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:16,360
and in addition to
what I said before is,

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,940
I think we miss
awareness in

203
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,775
the operational
community about NDN,

204
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:25,060
and this is something
that probably

205
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,350
prevents larger adoption
of software system.

206
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,680
For example, I never
heard someone talking

207
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,710
about NDN on at
NANOG for example.

208
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,990
But if you want to get
NDN out of the lab,

209
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,880
you'll need to
raise awareness

210
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,950
outside of the
research community.

211
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,010
>> James you mentioned
ossification.

212
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,810
It's becoming hard to use

213
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,190
anything other than IP.

214
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,590
What's your take on this?

215
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,305
>> Well, I think

216
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:05,935
to that problem
specifically,

217
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:12,054
I experienced this
problem in other areas,

218
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:14,290
having nothing to do with

219
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,920
networking per se,
like interfaces.

220
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,170
For example, we have

221
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,060
something in
Department of Defense

222
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,670
called mill standard 1553.

223
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,260
I don't know if any of
you've heard of It,

224
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,070
but It was an
aircraft interface

225
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,960
invented in the 1970s.

226
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,310
It was really
first put to use

227
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,930
on the 15 aircraft.

228
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,730
It's a very slow but
very deterministic.

229
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,155
I guess I'd call it
layer two technology.

230
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,120
It's still in use

231
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,430
today and we can't
get rid of It.

232
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,560
It keeps
reasserting itself,

233
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,520
and a lot of It is because

234
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,840
people are
comfortable with It.

235
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,775
They've used It before.

236
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,879
That is just a
tiny example

237
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,055
of how the
ossification problem

238
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,290
happens in things
having nothing to do

239
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,735
with, say,
Internet Protocol.

240
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:08,330
It's just a much
worse problem if we,

241
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,100
I think there's
a lot of beauty

242
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,530
and elegance in
the NDN concept.

243
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,120
I think people
appreciate that

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,510
even with overview
presentations.

245
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,020
But, I think

246
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,210
the would-be
proponents are

247
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,345
soon running into a
type of a buzz saw.

248
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:31,825
Because we find
people want

249
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:35,320
to legislate
the use of IP.

250
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,580
I may almost say,
well, It must

251
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,080
be IP that works good.

252
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,495
It's worked good
for so many years.

253
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,895
I think the conservativism

254
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,115
has a strong barrier.

255
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,470
I'm a big fan
of being able

256
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,925
to create maybe
educational,

257
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:56,140
ideas that help improve
educational exposure.

258
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,850
I've made appeals
for people,

259
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,815
to create, for example,

260
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:04,080
a virtual like
maybe a single

261
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,090
click Install
that allows you

262
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,040
to kick the tires on

263
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,960
NDN to work through

264
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,330
simple examples
and tutorials.

265
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,430
I'm finding that
It's difficult to

266
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,160
simply just grab NDN
and explore It if you

267
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,610
are a casual user.

268
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,560
I think that the
degree to which

269
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
that could be
done would go

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,555
a long way to show
people the benefits.

271
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:36,060
Let's just put It this
way, it can't hurt.

272
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,100
But there are significant
barriers and I

273
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,380
don't have easy answers.

274
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,690
I've thought about this
for a while and we've

275
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,810
demonstrated some
research implementations

276
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,190
of the idea,

277
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,790
and people will say,

278
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,840
"Yeah, that's pretty neat,

279
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,340
but I'm not really going

280
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,600
to be able to use It

281
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,100
because I have all
these rules that I,

282
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,660
and none of them are.,

283
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,820
they're all hostile for
new ideas like NDN,

284
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,560
I wish it weren't
the case.

285
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,025
>> I mean, inertia
is a problem.

286
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,050
We have been seeing
this for some time.

287
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,250
What can we do as a
community to make

288
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,050
them at least
take a look at

289
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,600
NDN and explore
and say that well,

290
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,050
this might make sense
for my use case.

291
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,375
You mentioned
a single click

292
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,075
Install documentation.

293
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,530
Well, I guess
documentation

294
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,775
is not going to help.

295
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:38,035
It's more easy to use
turn on solutions.

296
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:41,690
Maybe a container,
is that?

297
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,080
>> I like to
think things like

298
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,865
that, for example,

299
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,070
maybe even very

300
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,365
simplified web only
demonstration.

301
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,660
I think people who

302
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,640
get their hands
dirty, so to speak,

303
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,820
with networking and
understand the concepts.

304
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,440
[NOISE] I'm sorry.

305
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,029
They can spend the time

306
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,095
and they can tackle
the learning curve.

307
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:12,495
I think when people

308
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,390
get an overview
presentation,

309
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,760
it's also at a high
level, It's encapsulated.

310
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,500
They get the ideas.

311
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,300
But then there's
this vast chasm

312
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,070
between those
two extremes.

313
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,420
The people who
have the time to

314
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,340
invest and can in

315
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,830
their laboratories
show the benefits

316
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,300
and the casual people say,

317
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,730
well that sounds
like a neat idea.

318
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,380
There needs to be a

319
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,930
few increments in between,

320
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,710
and I would just
say educationally,

321
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,810
you can't hurt the
cause by looking for

322
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,100
more creative ways to

323
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,650
get these ideas
out in the world.

324
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,045
But things that allow,

325
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,830
I know even like
with Docker,

326
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,110
for example, there's
a docker Labs,

327
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,720
which is a neat idea where

328
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,510
you can go to a
website and for

329
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,015
four hours you get
to play with Docker

330
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,555
and you can do a lot
in a short time,

331
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,280
things like that for NDN

332
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,840
I think would help a lot.

333
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,020
I would certainly be
front at the line trying

334
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,110
to explore that myself

335
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,800
and I would certainly

336
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,005
share that with
colleagues.

337
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,535
But right now it's

338
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:26,405
a very rarified
group of people who

339
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,565
have the ability
to really dig in

340
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:31,190
and look in real
life at NDN,

341
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,530
if there's a much
bigger world out there

342
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,840
and you should consider

343
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,250
ways of reaching
that world.

344
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,360
It's not just aerospace,

345
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,190
just many other sectors,

346
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,590
but aerospace is the
one that I work in.

347
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,350
I know people are
attracted by the idea,

348
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,610
but then they
just quickly run

349
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,140
into lots of barriers.

350
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,030
>> Thank you. I
think we're going to

351
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,665
go to Christos
and Beichuan.

352
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,420
You have lot of experience

353
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,755
in NDN for different
use cases.

354
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:08,180
What's your take
on how we can make

355
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,595
this simpler for James
and his colleagues.

356
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,395
>> Since you put
my name first,

357
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,535
let me jump in.

358
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,830
First of all,
I'm so happy to

359
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,030
see so many people working

360
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,350
on applications on NDN.

361
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,630
That is exactly
what we need.

362
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,075
I want to remind
people that NDN has

363
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,130
a very unique
advantage compared to

364
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,200
IP in terms of when
was developed.

365
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,490
When IP was developed in

366
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,260
the 60s and the 70s,

367
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,850
people didn't really have

368
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,335
any experience
with networking.

369
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:40,520
They didn't know

370
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,760
what applications
would use networking.

371
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,480
There were some people

372
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,710
who never believed that

373
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,245
networking was important
or interesting.

374
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,090
It is not surprising that

375
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,634
they looked at
the telephone

376
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,540
which was the only
application that

377
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,445
we had that uses
networking and they said,

378
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:56,585
this is what we need,

379
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,625
let's build a network that

380
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,320
resembles the
phone network

381
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,940
and we know how that went.

382
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,000
Today with NDN, we
have a vast experience

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,835
with all applications
that use the network.

384
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,140
I think we're all here

385
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,520
because we believe that we

386
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,450
have a better way to do

387
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,730
networking than with IP.

388
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,520
But we need to use
that wisdom that we

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,340
have acquired by looking

390
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,185
at 50 years of
experience worth

391
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:24,170
of applications and try

392
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,750
to convince people who

393
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,979
use those applications

394
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,735
about the merits of NDN.

395
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,060
I think the best
way to do this

396
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,385
is to just go out there to

397
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,140
people who use
applications

398
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,730
and talk to them and

399
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,380
try to capture
their imagination.

400
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,430
We need to convince

401
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,540
the networking
researchers,

402
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,835
but we really need to
capture the imagination

403
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:47,244
of people who run
applications.

404
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,850
I'm so happy to
see Alex Feltus on

405
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,470
the panel because
I remember

406
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,110
talking to him at the
cc star PI meeting

407
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,330
and introducing
NDN to him.

408
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,200
He was interested,
he got it.

409
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,085
He was a big supporter
from day zero.

410
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,660
I was shocked
at how quickly

411
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,630
Alex got the
concept behind NDN.

412
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,880
We did the same
thing with climate

413
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,725
and high-energy
physics people.

414
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:17,000
We found groups,
communities

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,380
that had a need

416
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,170
and we tried to
speak to that need.

417
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,670
I think that was very

418
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,690
important thing in terms

419
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,990
of capturing their
imagination.

420
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,540
I'm trying to do
the same thing here

421
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,100
with the automotive
community.

422
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,370
The reason I'm doing
that, first of all,

423
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,900
it's a big domain,

424
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,370
it's a big application.

425
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,485
They have real needs.

426
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,885
Deploying a networking

427
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:47,360
on millions of vehicles,

428
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,569
connected vehicles,
autonomous vehicles.

429
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:53,510
The networking needs
insider vehicle.

430
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,325
The networking
needs some vehicles

431
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,350
to connect to the Cloud.

432
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,940
I don't have to

433
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,500
be speaking to
the choir here.

434
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,495
NDN is perfect for those.

435
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:05,585
They are asking questions

436
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:07,220
as they're moving to

437
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,679
IP that we were asking

438
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,330
when we were talking

439
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,620
about NDN at
the beginning.

440
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,880
The interesting
thing about

441
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,339
the automotive community
when they started

442
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,995
with simpler networks like

443
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,110
Cantor Controller
Area Network,

444
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,390
which was invented back
in the 80s by Bosch.

445
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,160
If you look at it, it

446
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,530
is the first ICN network.

447
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,080
It communicates by putting

448
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,060
names of signals
on the wire.

449
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,920
Very simple, very
primitive network,

450
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,500
but it is an
ICN network and

451
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,210
the automotive
community is

452
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,505
used to that paradigm.

453
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,575
We're forcing them into

454
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,810
an endpoint
communication with

455
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,300
IP and they're attracted

456
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,770
because of all the
standardization

457
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,820
or the work that
has gone in IP.

458
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,335
But this is not

459
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:59,110
the way they're used to
doing communication,

460
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,855
they're forced
into these now.

461
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:05,185
To summarize, I think
the best way to

462
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:08,665
evangelize and for
obligates NDN,

463
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,850
is to just go out there

464
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,670
find the Alex Feltus
service community.

465
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,180
We have real needs.
Talk to them.

466
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,225
There are people
out there who will

467
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:22,070
understand the
technical aspect

468
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,675
of NDN, and their
advantages.

469
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,640
Let's find them,
talk to them,

470
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,760
and see if we can convince
them that we have

471
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,835
a better way to do
things. That's it.

472
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:36,500
>> Thank Christos.
Beichuan.

473
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,560
>> I totally agree

474
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,165
with Christos
what has said.

475
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:46,280
We need to get the ideas

476
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,190
from people who
actually use NDN in

477
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,960
their domain
and figure out

478
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
what are the problems
they run into

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,040
and try to solve
this problem to make

480
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,270
NDN being very used.

481
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,225
I want to follow up on

482
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,300
James' comments

483
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,690
about making this
more approachable,

484
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,335
more accessible to
cover users that

485
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:14,030
who don't have a lot of

486
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,655
time to go through
the learning curves.

487
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:19,205
I think that's a very
important point.

488
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,440
In our experience, we've

489
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,735
found out a
couple of things.

490
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,490
One is when we did

491
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,000
this browser-based video

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,995
streaming using NDN,

493
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:34,310
we find that it's a
very good approach

494
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,810
to involve everyday
user to use this.

495
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,030
Even though they may

496
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,220
now know they're
using NDN,

497
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,560
but they actually
using NDN video

498
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,990
streaming and it can

499
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,340
be a very good
demonstration.

500
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,770
From NDN researcher or

501
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,020
developer point
of view, I think,

502
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,440
strengthen this
browser support

503
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,330
is a good way to

504
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,685
improve the
accessibility of NDN.

505
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:08,435
I'm glad to see yesterday,

506
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:12,605
future topologies,
tap square library.

507
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:15,680
Varun talked about
his NDN play,

508
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,765
which is web-based demo.

509
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:21,725
I think those are
very good things.

510
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,915
Another thing there is

511
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:27,810
plug-and-play of NDN code.

512
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,050
My experience from

513
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,925
other people's
appearance I talk to,

514
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,275
UL they are two things.

515
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:39,050
One is, when you
set up NDN nodes,

516
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,480
let's say even
very small scale

517
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,950
and you want to run some

518
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,900
single NDN applications,

519
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,765
turns out you had to
set up the routes.

520
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,340
You have to know
the IP address and

521
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,515
set up the routes,
and this and that.

522
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:53,630
Is very counterintuitive

523
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,385
when we talk about NDN.

524
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:58,730
We develop the so-called
self-learning,

525
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,040
which you basically build

526
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,540
customer first packet and

527
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,845
find out where data is.

528
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,110
Then in the later,
later packets,

529
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,790
you automatically set up

530
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,530
routes based on the result

531
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,550
of the first packet.

532
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,715
Another thing is the
security bootstrap

533
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:18,560
is very big part of

534
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,405
this so-called
plug-and-play,

535
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:22,895
and that's really
non-trivial

536
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,710
because it involves
the policy,

537
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,240
involves a schema and

538
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,685
how you automate
all of this.

539
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:33,840
I think that's part
require a lot of work.

540
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,535
Coming together all this,

541
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:40,895
how to say how do
the falling states,

542
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:43,115
how to bootstrap security,

543
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:45,365
they are all
important so that

544
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,990
a user without
the time to deep

545
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,840
into the technical
details can actually

546
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,120
run and again say out of

547
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,130
the box without
too much hassle.

548
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,320
That's also very important

549
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,140
for improve the
accessibility of NDN.

550
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,390
Couple of other things,

551
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,100
I think also mentioned in

552
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,800
yesterday's either
talk or panel,

553
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,495
one is for the
application developers

554
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,090
who don't know a lot about

555
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,720
NDN network
details and who

556
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,250
shouldn't need to know

557
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,355
those details for
them to use NDN.

558
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:29,915
There should be a good
high-level library or

559
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,520
API for them to

560
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,040
easily cool run
NDN applications.

561
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,725
Probably a single library
will not be enough.

562
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:48,275
But say people work
in vehicle network,

563
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:51,530
they may come out
with their library,

564
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,910
that will be really good.

565
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,775
Or Alex come up with
his library for

566
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:58,910
people in this biological
research area,

567
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,680
that would be really good

568
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,290
to increase the
accessibility.

569
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,320
The last point I
want to make is,

570
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,375
my personal wish is if
there's some framework

571
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,105
so that people can
follow to migrate

572
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:17,705
existing applications
to NDN application.

573
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,280
In a real world,

574
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,630
there's so many
application people

575
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,250
have put in

576
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,685
so much time to

577
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:28,325
really develop
those applications.

578
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:31,235
But I see the
biggest obstacle

579
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:34,040
of NDN deployment is

580
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,260
you require changes
to the application.

581
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,970
In TCP, IP, they

582
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,085
all address to
some port numbers.

583
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,410
But now we need names,

584
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,960
and we need name come
from the application.

585
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,685
I see that's the
biggest hurdle

586
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,800
more than how efficient,

587
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,285
how scalable
your network is,

588
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:59,450
is people have to
make changes to

589
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,280
their application
in order to get

590
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,110
a lot of benefit from
any architecture.

591
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,630
It's not a simple question
like you just make

592
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,250
a few changes to

593
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,470
the function call
or somewhere,

594
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,755
it dependent with
applications.

595
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,530
Sometimes you have to

596
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,255
go deep into the
application,

597
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:20,450
and sometimes the
application itself was

598
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,065
designed with this
data-centric remind,

599
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,105
you just change the

600
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:27,800
network communication part

601
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,260
or some function course
that you ignore.

602
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,225
But sometimes you
have to go deep.

603
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:35,120
If there's some framework

604
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,030
to guide people go
through these courses,

605
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,490
I think that will
be very helpful.

606
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,630
These are the more
technical point,

607
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,970
I think what we need to

608
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,200
do in order to improve

609
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
the accessibility of NDN.

610
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,100
>> Beichuan, I'll

611
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,140
come to Alex
pretty soon and he

612
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,670
can tell us if I'm
thinking this correctly,

613
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,440
but you mentioned
that there're

614
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,600
simple applications
that we

615
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,565
can get them
started with NDN.

616
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,805
But I think
people like Alex,

617
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:16,040
they would take that
simple application.

618
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,450
They'll move
to the complex

619
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,710
stage pretty quickly.

620
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,180
Then that point,

621
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,265
the problem then
becomes on how

622
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,980
can I do this cool
thing with NDN.

623
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,220
It's not, can I get
started with NDN.

624
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,690
We need to have

625
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,140
more primitive
approach for

626
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,460
accessibility
and then more

627
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,520
advanced approach
where people

628
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,340
can actually play
the NDN libraries.

629
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,080
I think Alex,
you'd be better

630
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,350
suited to comment
on this one.

631
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,246
>> Can you hear me?

632
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:52,840
>> Yeah.. [NOISE]

633
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,290
>> If we're talking

634
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,700
about accessibility still,

635
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,950
I was trying to
think about that.

636
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,870
There's really
two versions

637
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,895
of accessibility for NDN.

638
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,520
Starting with the
real end-user,

639
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,540
the biologist,

640
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,489
I want to get it from
their perspective

641
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:07,990
that we need

642
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,454
a content delivery
system for genomes

643
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:13,720
where the genomes have
been processed and may

644
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,750
be downstream analysis in

645
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,190
those datasets where
we need to be able to

646
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,690
have them be
passed around and

647
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,245
a naming system is what
attracts me to NDN.

648
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,495
From an accessibility,

649
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,250
I need a data lake
and we're working

650
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,780
on the hydro project
together full

651
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,000
disclosure for

652
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,995
creating this
repository where

653
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,470
an application can
go in and say,

654
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,150
give me this version of

655
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,430
the human genome that's
been named properly,

656
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,040
then pull it into
a complex workflow

657
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,480
and then go out and have

658
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,190
all the troubleshooting
and everything

659
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,330
break after that because

660
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,425
whenever you're doing,

661
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,180
data intensive
genomics work,

662
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,260
it's always broken at

663
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,470
all levels of the
data lifecycle.

664
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,060
It's insane and I spend

665
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,800
a lot of my time teaching

666
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,990
how to troubleshoot just

667
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,490
the really bad
software systems.

668
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,840
But from

669
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,820
an NDN accessibility
perspective for user,

670
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,900
I just needed to
have the ability

671
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,450
for a person who
writes workflows,

672
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,880
writes links
applications together

673
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,140
to go and pull
data into it,

674
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,520
pull it in with a name.

675
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,035
That's really all
they need to know,

676
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:16,555
how to access this
documentation,

677
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,910
access the data lake,

678
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,140
pull data with the name

679
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,435
and move forward
with your stuff.

680
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:25,630
The other part of
the accessibility is

681
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,130
me trying to develop

682
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,245
the system and
I cannot do.

683
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,165
We've been doing it for
quite a while now and

684
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:34,420
I'm not a computer scientist
or network engineer,

685
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm a bioinformatician
where

686
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,185
I know how to do stuff,

687
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,495
makes hack basically,

688
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,420
a lot of the data
and the workflows,

689
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,920
but I have to
work with Susmit

690
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,560
and Christos and
some other people

691
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,390
that I've been
working with on

692
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,370
implementing
this stuff with

693
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,375
people in my lab,

694
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,940
where I get part of
an FTE to program

695
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,155
on this for a few years

696
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:57,520
and get this to happen.

697
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,445
Then we've had major
accessibility problems,

698
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:01,990
even with working directly

699
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,250
with people in
the community,

700
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,650
they're awesome
with implementing

701
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,790
it on the system.

702
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,110
We have to have this stuff

703
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,565
work on a real system.

704
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:13,090
We use several distributed
Cloud-based systems,

705
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,725
again this
cluster we have,

706
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,840
and then there's problems
with networking.

707
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,705
Whenever trying
the test bed,

708
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:21,805
there's firewall issues or

709
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,800
just trying to get
containers to run on

710
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,930
a distributed
Kubernetes system and

711
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,360
being able to
have to turn on

712
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,980
some particular
networking aspect

713
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,345
that's been blocked

714
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,480
by the system
administrator, the system.

715
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,010
It's like trying to

716
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,360
get this thing
just to turn on

717
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,570
the switch and is

718
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,110
hard and that's from

719
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,805
an accessibility
perspective.

720
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:44,890
I wouldn't even begin
to do anything that I'm

721
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,780
trying to do
without direct help

722
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,910
from the computer science

723
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,730
network engineer community
that's here today.

724
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,530
I think the
accessibility is

725
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,840
basically zero
for somebody

726
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,640
like me based upon

727
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,725
the documentation and
things like that.

728
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:00,310
I wouldn't know how to

729
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,150
start to solve the problem

730
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,955
without having
my handheld.

731
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,320
I feel like it's coming

732
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,775
from the other
way too that,

733
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:10,345
I know what we need
after we get the data,

734
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:13,435
the usage after that
and try to make

735
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:15,970
the downstream
applications accessible to

736
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,650
the networking
community too

737
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,375
is what I'm trying to do.

738
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:23,800
Does that make any
sense? [NOISE]

739
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,330
>> Yeah, and I think
Beichuan talked about

740
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,655
this high-level
libraries and I think

741
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,410
Alex mentioned

742
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,580
[OVERLAPPING] its use
had been stopped.

743
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,825
Do you think if we had

744
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,550
high-level libraries that

745
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,975
implemented NDN primitive
that would be more?

746
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:45,970
I know we spend
a lot of time in

747
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,115
the first part
setting things up,

748
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,155
the forwarding and
getting all that working,

749
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:54,495
but that part can be
solved by having,

750
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,860
let's say,
virtual machines

751
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,455
or Docker containers.

752
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:59,470
The next part is
more challenging.

753
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,100
How do you integrate
NDN with your,

754
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,420
as Beichuan was saying,
existing workflows?

755
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,830
If we had high-level
libraries

756
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,000
that can take
care of that,

757
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,280
do you think that
would be more useful?

758
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,660
[NOISE]

759
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,790
>> Definitely, I have to have
a high level libraries, yes,

760
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,200
that will make it
more easy, but also

761
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,355
a system where I can
publish data from.

762
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:28,810
Right now, I'm
so interested

763
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,820
in creating the system,

764
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,905
creating the data
lake to be able to

765
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,930
use high-level
libraries to

766
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,805
interact with that place.

767
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:38,050
That's where we're trying

768
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,070
to get the containers and

769
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,440
everything packed
together right

770
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,180
now to have a system
that's functional.

771
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,790
[OVERLAPPING] The
answer is yes,

772
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,230
that'll be very helpful,

773
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm sure, but
we're not even at

774
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,375
that stage for me.

775
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,000
>> You're saying the
accessibility challenges

776
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,800
are three levels, not two.

777
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,270
Getting started and then

778
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,610
getting the
infrastructure up,

779
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,660
and then doing the high
level applications.

780
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,625
>> Yes.

781
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,275
>> Okay.

782
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,760
>> Yes. We haven't
gotten there

783
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,770
yet to the high level
applications, yes.

784
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,330
We will need
that very soon.

785
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,780
>> The NDN community has

786
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,205
a couple of testbeds,

787
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:22,780
where NDN can run,
things can happen.

788
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,660
Do you think, and
this is the question

789
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,870
for all the other
panelists as well.

790
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,940
Just having a
testbed is that

791
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,890
sufficient or
do you want to

792
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,525
take this and run in on

793
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:40,910
your own system,
the infrastructure?

794
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,125
>> I would say that
the testbed is great.

795
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,090
I think the fact that
it has, I think,

796
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,830
36 notes as Zhang said

797
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,005
yesterday and
spans the world,

798
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:54,490
except Australia
and Antarctica

799
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,795
, I think you said.

800
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,520
That's wonderful,
and it's there

801
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,325
and a lot of
people can use it.

802
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:03,190
But it's a large

803
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,260
network Internet
style testbed.

804
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,220
We need more testbeds
for other applications.

805
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,720
Matthias, I think
will agree with me

806
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,335
that we need testbeds
to do IoT devices.

807
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:15,490
I'm looking at testbeds

808
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,535
that do automotive
devices.

809
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:20,440
I think as a community,

810
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,840
we should support

811
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,795
the big testbeds
and it's wonderful.

812
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,165
We should
definitely support

813
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:31,030
all other types of
testbeds where NDN can be

814
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,890
applied because that shows

815
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,865
generality of
application for NDN.

816
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,200
It is challenging to

817
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,220
do these testbeds because

818
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,170
each application that we

819
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,700
look at is different.

820
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,980
As an example, in
automotive applications,

821
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,050
they were looking at

822
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,540
creating testbeds
that yes,

823
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,850
are composed of ECUs,

824
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,135
which resemble
the sensor nets

825
00:34:58,135 --> 00:34:59,290
approach, if you like,

826
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,750
constrained devices,
except that may

827
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,320
be the power concern
is not as big.

828
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,265
The automotive environment
wants applications

829
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:10,990
with networks that are

830
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,030
very light in
terms of weight,

831
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,950
I mean the physical
weight, because they

832
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,545
care about what
goes into the car.

833
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:20,230
That was an eye-opening
for me when I started

834
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,030
talking to
automotive people,

835
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,425
they said, "Well,

836
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,030
we're moving
into automotive

837
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,155
ethernet then you guys

838
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,340
use wires that have eight

839
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,630
conductors in them,"
and I'm like,

840
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,920
"Yeah, we need them to

841
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,640
do hundreds of
gigabits per second."

842
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,600
They are like, "Wait,

843
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,040
we don't need hundreds
of gigabytes per

844
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,725
second and your wires
are too heavy."

845
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:40,180
I'm like, "What are
you talking about?

846
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,245
Wires are light."

847
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:43,390
Then they said,
"Did you know

848
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,520
that the wiring
harness in a car is

849
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,690
the third most heavy
item in a car?"

850
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,405
I'm like, "No, I
have no idea."

851
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:54,550
We do need to get into

852
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,920
these domains and try
to understand what

853
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,290
the requirements
are and learn more

854
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,820
about these different
application

855
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,350
domains and speak

856
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,310
their language and
perhaps start looking

857
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:11,630
into these things.
Yeah, that's it.

858
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,050
>> Mathias, you want to?

859
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,790
>> Yeah. I definitely
agree with Christos,

860
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,250
but the other thing
is also that we

861
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,190
really need to
raise awareness.

862
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,710
I'm not really sure

863
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,925
whether the question about

864
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,190
accessibility is
the right question

865
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,050
because as we talked,

866
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,600
these things that
are there and

867
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,905
the infrastructure
that is there is

868
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,215
accessible and can
be used to this use,

869
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:43,270
but it may be used by

870
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,455
a quiet confined group
of people and users.

871
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,950
This is because
people who we

872
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,330
would like to see
that they are using

873
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,910
NDN are not aware of NDN.

874
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,375
We really should try to
engage other groups,

875
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:04,275
which means that the
NDN community should be

876
00:37:04,275 --> 00:37:08,010
visible at other events

877
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,620
that are not NDN
or ICN specific.

878
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,865
>> That's a great point.

879
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:18,130
I think we can go back to

880
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,810
James' comment
about having

881
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,685
a Docker container
or something.

882
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:24,550
What would be
the specific way

883
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,295
of creating the
statements?

884
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:32,770
These are not
easy to create.

885
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,315
We can create a
docker container,

886
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:35,710
but creating a
testbed out of

887
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,200
docker containers,
that's more involved.

888
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,740
[NOISE] With the
accessibility needs,

889
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,810
creating different
testbeds

890
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,595
for different
applications,

891
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:50,330
that's something we need
to also think about.

892
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,855
>> Sorry, go ahead.

893
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:57,100
>> You go ahead, sorry.

894
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,980
>> You mean
that a user can

895
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,420
more or less
virtually create

his own test bed
out-of-the-box.

897
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,520
You mean something
like this?

00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,680
>> Right. Test
bed in a box.

899
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,625
>> [OVERLAPPING]
I'm sorry.

900
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,245
I keep interrupting.

901
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:21,220
>> I was just going to
say, I think the idea

902
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,370
of something that can
be approached quickly,

903
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,650
easily, and put to use,

904
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,220
one form of that
is, for example,

905
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,950
either a web accessible
or a single click

906
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,990
install environment

907
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,790
with examples
and tutorials,

908
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,695
that would be helpful.

with things like

910
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,880
Arduinos and
Raspberry ***,

911
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,400
of course there are
companies like SparkFun.

912
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,020
I can't remember the
name of one ecosystem I

913
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,700
saw where you could

914
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,280
buy different blocks
and put them together.

915
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,150
This is partly education,

916
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:09,249
partly lowering the
boundaries for access.

917
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:12,040
I think there's a
variety of ways.

918
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,800
But otherwise, test beds,

919
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,320
just as a generic idea,

920
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,650
I think certainly
in aerospace,

921
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,440
I've seen many multimillion
dollar test beds.

922
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,780
I think test beds
by themselves

923
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,470
without maybe something
more in mind,

924
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,670
it depends on
what the purpose

925
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,720
of the test bed is,

926
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,355
but I think that

927
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,930
you could create
essentially

928
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,980
a large number of

929
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,680
very easily
accessible test beds

930
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,000
in the form of
the things I've

931
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,130
mentioned and I
feel that it'll be

932
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,800
a great benefit to that.

933
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,915
>> Beichuan, do you
have any comments?

934
00:39:54,915 --> 00:40:00,175
>> Can I go back to
Alex's [NOISE] situation.

935
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,735
She said she has
all the help

936
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,890
from Indian people,

937
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,270
but he has
really difficult

938
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,160
time to get the system up.

939
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,665
That's not due to

940
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:10,900
the configuration
setup on Indian,

941
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,595
but due to the
configuration of

942
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:15,640
underlying network
reachability,

943
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,885
is that right?

944
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:18,700
Like the firewalls and

945
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,025
other stuff are
blocking somehow

946
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:23,950
your nose or long
different size

947
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,050
come to each
other in India.

948
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,000
>> There's so
many problems.

949
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
I found that when I'm
developing systems,

950
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,320
that's always the
fundamental problem,

951
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,200
especially when I'm
using campus test beds,

952
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,000
is that getting
the person on

953
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,190
the phone to go and change

954
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,290
a firewall rule or fix

955
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,370
something or just reboot

956
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,590
the computer can be
very challenging.

957
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,550
We're trying to build
virtualized test beds

958
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,010
on democratized
Kubernetes systems

959
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,600
and fabric as well,

960
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,070
so that we could
just build it up

961
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,510
ourselves and have
control over it.

962
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,955
>> But this problem,

963
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,010
probably other
people will run

964
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,675
into similar
problem as well,

965
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,010
because when
they deal with

966
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,300
real-world network with

967
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,295
all these restrictions.

968
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:15,775
Thinking in terms
of accessibility,

969
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:22,430
what can we do to
solve this problem?

970
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,830
If we proxy
everything over HTTP,

971
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,700
you probably can get

972
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,690
through all the firewall,

973
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,630
but you have all this
downside of doing that.

974
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,250
But that's a real

975
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,870
problem people
can run into.

976
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,510
Even it's not your
Indian's code,

977
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,015
but it's
accessibility problem

978
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:44,500
in the real world.

979
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,480
>> Yeah, the
real world to me

980
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,850
is a system that's already

981
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,050
existing and being able to

982
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,510
layer Indian applications
on top of that,

983
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:52,900
because we're trying

984
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,160
to build this repository.

985
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
That's our use case
with big datasets.

986
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,925
We need 1-100 petabytes of

987
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:03,309
storage in this repository

988
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,305
to be able to do anything.

989
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:07,870
Even on a small
collaboration level,

990
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,530
that's the storage you
need to do genomics.

991
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,580
>> Alex, let me
ask you this,

992
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,350
is the problem setting up

993
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,960
the infrastructure
or is the problem

994
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,340
setting up the
infrastructure

995
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,390
and Indian software?

996
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,775
>> We have a
campus cluster,

997
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:40,510
two distributed
Kubernetes systems

998
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,920
that we do a
lot to work on,

999
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,330
and the Open Science Grid,

1000
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,545
I won't even go there.

1001
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:47,320
But the
infrastructure exists

1002
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,370
and we need to be able

1003
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,350
to have Indian function

1004
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,465
in those existing
infrastructures.

1005
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:54,730
That's got to map with

1006
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,320
different
Kubernetes systems.

1007
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,820
They're configured
differently.

1008
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,360
The ability of
containers to

1009
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,115
communicate with
each other is

1010
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:04,510
dictated by the policy

1011
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,000
of the person who
built the cluster.

1012
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We're lucky enough to
be able to work with

1013
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,290
the leadership of some of

1014
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,885
the systems in their
experimental systems,

1015
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,700
NSF-funded systems to be

1016
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,125
able to configure it.

1017
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,060
My ultimate goal
is to be able to

1018
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,980
have not a
button to press,

1019
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,810
but complex
documentation to set up

1020
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,630
a data lake in a
commercial Cloud,

1021
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,060
then I have the ability
and get funding

1022
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,840
for that and keep it up

1023
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,460
for as long as I want,

1024
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,455
and have control
over that.

1025
00:43:32,455 --> 00:43:33,490
I have to pay the bills,

1026
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,515
but not trying to

1027
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:37,690
map this to
different campuses,

1028
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,190
because no one campus has

1029
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,110
enough resources
including my own.

1030
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,555
We have a top 300 cluster,

1031
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,130
but it's not enough
to do my work.

1032
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,160
We're entering a phase in

1033
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,645
genomics where we're
going to have,

1034
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:52,300
I don't know, the
private sector,

1035
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,135
a million Exascale users

1036
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,220
who need to work
at the Exascale

1037
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,065
to be able to
do their work.

1038
00:43:59,065 --> 00:44:02,479
We're running out
of electrons.

1039
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,510
>> What you're saying
implicitly is that

1040
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,410
it's important to get

1041
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,690
the DevOps
people involved.

1042
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,110
>> Yes.

1043
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,250
>> Those who manage

1044
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,840
the network for
you and they

1045
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,980
should start to laugh
and like in the end.

1046
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,300
Then if they do this,

1047
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,490
and they take care

1048
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,475
that basic stuff
is running.

1049
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:26,425
They configure
the firewall

1050
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,690
automatically and so on.

1051
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,190
Getting DevOps
super involved

1052
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,140
seems to be a
crucial point.

1053
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,970
>> They're involved,
but I have

1054
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:34,990
to be very careful where I

1055
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,580
don't get them involved

1056
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,360
too much where
they don't want

1057
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,440
to talk to me anymore.

1058
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,840
>> No. [LAUGHTER] I

1059
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,565
also means in the end
community actually.

1060
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:44,740
Maybe you should
approach DevOps people,

1061
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,375
since they already know

1062
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,670
in the end concepts and
software and so on,

1063
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,080
it's already
prepared if you

1064
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,520
want to use it in advance.

1065
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,110
>> We're working with

1066
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,585
FIA, Tennessee Tech, UCLA.

1067
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:00,460
I would assume
that if there is

1068
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,440
a need that we need
from the community

1069
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,990
that the Indian people
that I'm working with

1070
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,490
will help identify

1071
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,215
the DevOps people
or whenever.

1072
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:10,760
We need to get
the job done.

1073
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,685
>> I'd like to mention
one thing about the,

1074
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:19,780
I don't know what
the word was,

1075
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,380
but to be able

1076
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,455
to get people
excited about NDN.

1077
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:24,670
This is, I think,

1078
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,275
an overlooked thing a lot.

1079
00:45:26,275 --> 00:45:28,540
I see this from a lot
of IT perspectives,

1080
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,895
is that there's faculty.

1081
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,750
I have 100 student
bioinformatics class.

1082
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,180
Their Linux labs
where they go in

1083
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,010
VMs and run workflows,

1084
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,300
I teach them how
to do that stuff

1085
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,740
at the undergraduate
level.

1086
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,540
Once I have a
test bed working,

1087
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,220
instead of going
and teaching them

1088
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,125
some complicated
way to go click and

1089
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,420
all these different
things and pull down

1090
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,360
a genome from some
weird web service,

1091
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,680
where I'll have them go,

1092
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,780
take the name and pull
out of the test bed.

1093
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,195
What I'll do is
I probably train

1094
00:45:58,195 --> 00:46:01,480
300 people a year
in my classes and

1095
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,530
workshops and I would

1096
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,790
expose 300 people a year

1097
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,290
to a system where they

1098
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,940
can get the data
from a NDN system.

1099
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,730
I would take the time
to explain what NDN is,

1100
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,135
the philosophy of it,

1101
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,355
and how cool it is,
all that stuff.

1102
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,250
Let's say you put
in classes from

1103
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,750
the educational
perspective and people

1104
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,130
will not know they

1105
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,630
weren't supposed to
know what NDN was,

1106
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,800
so they've been
taught about

1107
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,760
it. They'll think
it's normal.

1108
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,030
>> I think we started
with ossification.

1109
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,200
How do we end?

1110
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,015
The other panel also
talked about it.

1111
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,160
How do we put
our interface

1112
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,205
existing applications
with NDN.

1113
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,545
For some applications,
it's easy,

1114
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:54,215
so they're starting from
scratch, maybe IoT.

1115
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:56,260
Some applications
already have

1116
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,880
so much time
invested in it,

1117
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,505
they don't want to
get the grid of that.

1118
00:47:00,505 --> 00:47:02,845
What's your take on this?

1119
00:47:02,845 --> 00:47:05,560
How do we interface

1120
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,815
existing applications
with NDN?

1121
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:11,870
What's the best
way of doing this?

1122
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,675
>> I can answer what
we're doing with that.

1123
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:28,270
We're going to see,

1124
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,680
we have to have
the test bed

1125
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,320
that has enough
functionality.

1126
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,680
It's got enough
performance to be

1127
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,725
able to use it to
pull data from.

1128
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:37,270
But then once we do that,

1129
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,355
we already have
existing data

1130
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,865
transfer mechanisms,

1131
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:42,415
IP-based things from
the repositories

1132
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:43,900
and we'll just
swap that out

1133
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,310
in our workflows.

1134
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,320
We have a workflow manager
system that we use

1135
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,900
for running our
applications.

1136
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,330
We'll just make
that a data stream.

1137
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,730
We'll swap it out from
our existing things.

1138
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,700
I don't think
it's going to be

1139
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,325
hard for us to do that.

1140
00:47:57,325 --> 00:48:00,025
But we have to have a
functional test bed.

1141
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:02,005
I use the P word.

1142
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,940
I need a
production system.

1143
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,385
Most people don't like
that word production.

1144
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,470
I need a system
that is production,

1145
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,600
meaning that it works
95 percent of the time.

1146
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,510
That's my definition of
a production system.

1147
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,580
>> Christos, you were
saying something.

1148
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,000
>> Yeah. I mean,

1149
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,385
it's a really
tough question.

1150
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:23,140
But it's a very
important question

1151
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,170
because if we tell people

1152
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,740
we don't know
how you can take

1153
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,820
your existing application

1154
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,900
and run it over NDN,

1155
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,360
then they're going
to just walk away.

1156
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,159
I'm not sure if we have
done that exercise,

1157
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,360
but maybe doing
an exercise

1158
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,605
where we take an existing
application and try

1159
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:42,790
to put NDN under

1160
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,755
it might be worthwhile

1161
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,170
and doing it for a
few applications.

1162
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,360
I'm going to go out on
a limb here and say

1163
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,890
that if maybe we can find

1164
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,680
applications that
were written well

1165
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,180
from a software
engineering point

1166
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,740
of view and they
are modular,

1167
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,990
and maybe we can try to

1168
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,315
yank out IP and
put in the end.

1169
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:03,700
I know that this is
oversimplifying things,

1170
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,655
but I think we
can be selective.

1171
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,515
If we can find
these applications

1172
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,765
and do a few
demonstrations,

1173
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:13,090
then we will at least

1174
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,440
have proof that
it can be done.

1175
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,150
Going from zero
to one or two,

1176
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,545
it's a huge step.

1177
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:24,460
Then yes, we can argue
and somebody says,

1178
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,390
"Well, I tried to do it

1179
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:26,820
and it was terrible."

1180
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,690
Then we can write
our finger and say,

1181
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:28,900
well,

1182
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,550
your application wasn't
written properly.

1183
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,230
Otherwise, look we did it,

1184
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,875
and it was easy,

1185
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,770
with an application
that was well-written.

1186
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,940
But I think that this is

1187
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,830
a really important
exercise

1188
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,010
that we should
try to deal with.

1189
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,640
The problem is
that I don't

1190
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,310
know if I can get an
NSF funding to do

1191
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,260
that and I don't
know if I can

1192
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,885
graduate a student
doing that.

1193
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:51,070
Hopefully, I
can get a paper

1194
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,705
in place here and
if I do that.

1195
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:54,670
But we need to find
the right incentives

1196
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,860
and absolutely do this.

1197
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,990
I think maybe
it's going to

1198
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,940
take a little bit of

1199
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,890
time finding the
right application so

1200
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,990
that we can put our
NDN, but we shouldn't.

1201
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,720
>> I'm going to go to

1202
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,030
Matthias and
then Beichuan,

1203
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,605
I know Beichuan worked
on this before.

1204
00:50:11,605 --> 00:50:15,340
Matthias, I think
for IoT It's easier,

1205
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,425
we have the new devices.

1206
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:23,650
Well, I don't know.
[OVERLAPPING].

1207
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,855
>> You're right.
It's easy because

1208
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,770
we just start
from scratch.

1209
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,230
That means I had to
use devices that we're

1210
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,945
looking on vary
constraint.

1211
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,445
We do not have
much memory,

1212
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:34,810
which means that we cannot

1213
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:38,450
easily integrate
some middle value.

1214
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,105
Our applications for
NDN are written from

1215
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,770
scratch base for
our NDN ICN.

1216
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,060
If you ask whether
we can challenge by

1217
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,270
implementing
specific use cases

1218
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,585
based on the NDN.

1219
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,455
I mean, there have been

1220
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:57,855
ongoing discussions

1221
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,725
about push and
pull this stuff,

1222
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:03,560
but this is not

1223
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,885
a real challenge
that you can solve.

1224
00:51:07,885 --> 00:51:10,090
>> Okay. Thank you.

1225
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,240
I'm thinking this is

1226
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,720
accessibility problem

1227
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,445
because most
of the people,

1228
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:17,620
as James was saying,
coming from IP,

1229
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,900
they have already an
application model

1230
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,430
or application in mind.

1231
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,105
They look at NDN
and say well,

1232
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:25,335
I don't want to

1233
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,710
rewrite the whole
application.

1234
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,190
Beichuan, I think your
student did a lot

1235
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,085
of work in translating
between IP and NDN.

1236
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:38,880
>> Susmit, can I

1237
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,990
interrupt for
just a second?

1238
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,270
You have a raised
hand in the audience,

1239
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,245
someone who wants to

1240
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:46,940
get some real-world
experience.

1241
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,370
>> Unfortunately,
I don't see it.

1242
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,880
Maybe Kevin you can help.

1243
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,580
>> Guys, it's
right here. I just

1244
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,560
unmuted my microphone,
I think it's me.

1245
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,075
>> Okay. Yeah, sure.

1246
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,770
>> Okay. I've got a
lot to get through,

1247
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,870
so I'm going to talk
really quickly.

1248
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,040
What you really
fundamentally talking about

1249
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,725
here is diffusion
of innovation.

1250
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,000
Everett Rogers wrote
the book titled

1251
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,315
that and the core of it.

1252
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:13,820
This is everything
you've been talking

1253
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,530
about and then I can

1254
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,030
share what we've
done here.

1255
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,160
He says that to

1256
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,790
diffuse innovation
into a market,

1257
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,325
you have to be accessible,

1258
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:22,810
not complex, compatible,

1259
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,615
observable, tolerable.

1260
00:52:24,615 --> 00:52:28,000
The core things that
you're talking about,

1261
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,590
Christos is exactly right.

1262
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,850
You've got to find
a green field site

1263
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:32,860
and a green fields
customer and

1264
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,075
that's almost impossible,

1265
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:35,425
except I think we might

1266
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:39,140
be this close to
having got it done.

1267
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,700
The other thing
that you keep

1268
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,100
saying is the world is IP,

1269
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,385
and that is an
incredible battleship

1270
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:49,660
that frankly,

1271
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,615
I don't think we're
going to turn.

1272
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:54,290
The approach that
we've taken is to work

1273
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,260
with the network
equipment vendors

1274
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,330
because they are the
guys [inaudible] here.

1275
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,205
We're working
with Nokia and

1276
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:01,660
some very smart guys in

1277
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,075
Australia to get this.

1278
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:06,460
Our plan is to build

1279
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,500
a joule stack on
a Nokia service

1280
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,355
rather in a new open
SO Bluemix service

1281
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,510
rather and to
build our stack,

1282
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:16,300
which is half of
which is effectively

1283
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,860
a known domain that
we're making or an

1284
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,110
information centric
networking protocol.

1285
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,850
The other thing we
combine, which I think,

1286
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,860
Alex addresses some of

1287
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,510
your issues and I talked

1288
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,280
about this in one of
the forums before,

1289
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,690
it's distributed
storage to get

1290
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,595
this mass-scale storage
thing happening.

1291
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:34,860
We're going to build
this into a stack

1292
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,750
so that it will sit in
the router and hold

1293
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,950
the switch and
you'll be able to do

1294
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,640
TCPIP or recognize a
packet and say okay,

1295
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,295
well, this is a content
centric packets,

1296
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,645
it's a span AI packet
which is our protocol.

1297
00:53:46,645 --> 00:53:49,270
I know about this,
I can deal with it.

1298
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,340
Then you would obviously

1299
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,260
have to build gateways.

1300
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,645
What that does is

1301
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,830
that then addresses
those two problems.

1302
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,325
Then to get it
up and working,

1303
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:01,675
Christos, you're
absolutely right.

1304
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:02,860
You got to find
green fields.

1305
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,305
Like I said, well,

1306
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:05,770
I think hopefully
a week or two

1307
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,030
away from something
very [OVERLAPPING].

1308
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,140
>> I think we lost
you for a moment.

1309
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,610
>> Am I back yet? I'm on

1310
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,260
a pretty dodgy connection

1311
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,270
in Australia. Sorry,
guys. Am I back?

1312
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,995
>> I can still hear him.

1313
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:19,450
>> I think we lost Susmit.

1314
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,950
>> Yeah I can hear you.

1315
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,350
>> I think we lost Susmit.

1316
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,045
>> Rhett, you can continue

1317
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:25,430
talking. Hopefully,
Susmit will come back.

1318
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,670
>> Okay. Where was I?

1319
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,325
My train of thought
got interrupted.

1320
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:33,800
Yeah. That's what
we're proposing to do.

1321
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,450
The process of
diffusion is you guys

1322
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,860
need to find your
early adopter

1323
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,300
and guess what? Here I am.

1324
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,860
Because I'm some
crazy guy who has

1325
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,780
been doing private
research on this,

1326
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,070
privately funded research;

1327
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,780
chunk of my own money,
chunk of my mates

1328
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,165
money for 10 years.

1329
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:53,000
Here's the thing to the
observability pace,

1330
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,030
I didn't discover you
guys until we were

1331
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,130
doing some work with
Protocol Labs on

1332
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,170
IPFS and helping them to

1333
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,405
optimize some of the

1334
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:03,055
unfortunate decisions
that they have taken.

1335
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:05,620
In one of their RFPs
for R and D was

1336
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,360
this little one
line paper that I

1337
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,710
think we've seen and you

1338
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,165
may even have been
an author of.

1339
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:11,260
It said, "Hey,

1340
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,090
we think this might
be a useful thing to

1341
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,135
unify IPFS in the
end," and I'm,

1342
00:55:16,135 --> 00:55:19,525
oh yeah, that's a
very useful thing.

1343
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,550
I know I've got
to cover a lot of

1344
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,835
ground there,
but in essence,

1345
00:55:23,835 --> 00:55:25,700
that's the challenge
and I relate to

1346
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,620
it completely because like

1347
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,430
I said in the comments,

1348
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,605
this is what I
do for a living.

1349
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:29,800
But it's about

1350
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,570
finding who wants
what you got.

1351
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,550
That's the essence of it.

1352
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,310
I'm that weird guy,
right now I'm here.

1353
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,400
[LAUGHTER] Then we've
got a weird guy,

1354
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,560
I'm amazed, that we found,

1355
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,960
who has very
serious budget

1356
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,220
to spend on this and build

1357
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,110
a global network that will

1358
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,720
be a content-based
network.

1359
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,170
[OVERLAPPING] Try
it, it helps.

1360
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,120
Specifically Alex,
before I go,

1361
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,410
you might want to get

1362
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,880
in touch with an advisor,

1363
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,350
a guy called
Jonathan Hall,

1364
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,620
who works with
the Protocol

1365
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,945
Labs and talk on guys.

1366
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,475
He built a
genomic database.

1367
00:56:03,475 --> 00:56:07,020
He's the Chief
Medical Officer

1368
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,420
currently for
ConsenSys Medical,

1369
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,770
spelled with an S-Y-S,

1370
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:13,960
which is Joe
Lupin's company

1371
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,310
for commercializing
a theorem.

1372
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,590
Joe gets this.
Joe understands.

1373
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,320
You have to put it
out in the market.

1374
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,150
If you look at ConsenSys,

1375
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:26,810
with a Y-S,
that's the model.

1376
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:27,940
If you look at
Protocol Labs,

1377
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,590
they have done a
genius job admittedly.

1378
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,005
They had 200 million
bucks that they

1379
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:32,725
raised in a prions
here to play with.

1380
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:33,990
But they have done
this brilliantly.

1381
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,835
They've just gone
from basically,

1382
00:56:38,835 --> 00:56:41,980
a library of p to p
storage applications to

1383
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,760
a complete system that's

1384
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,835
now out in the market
and got a market cap.

1385
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,170
Well, I think it
changed today,

1386
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,290
but billions and
billions of dollars.

1387
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,305
That's the prices.
Read Everett Rogers,

1388
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:54,880
find who wants
what you've got.

1389
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,290
I'm here. I'm
happy to help.

1390
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,620
>> Well, thank you.

1391
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,140
>> Thank you for
the comments,

1392
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,860
those are very useful.

1393
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,540
I have a question for you,

1394
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,245
I think you're

1395
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:07,835
the right person
to answer this.

1396
00:57:07,835 --> 00:57:10,070
With NDN we often run into

1397
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,080
this brick wall
that says, well,

1398
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,970
you guys don't have
any standards and we

1399
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,010
are an industry,
we need standards.

1400
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,375
We need to prove we

1401
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,500
only work with
things at work.

1402
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,910
How do you have

1403
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,680
the conversation
with customers?

1404
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,970
We say that, when they

1405
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,350
come back to you
and they say, well,

1406
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,850
IP checks all
the boxes that

1407
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,380
I need and then we scream

1408
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,060
and yell we'll look

1409
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,770
inside that box
is checked.

1410
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,090
It's really not
as great as we

1411
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,505
think you are. How did
you deal with this?

1412
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:40,010
>> Very good
question. The answer

1413
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,270
is a big part
of what we're

1414
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,780
going to do is we're

1415
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,560
going to publish
standards,

1416
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,840
so we're going
to design it,

1417
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,545
we're going to build it,

1418
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,555
and then we're going
to publish the APIs

1419
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:48,800
at a couple of levels at

1420
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,730
the routing level and at

1421
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,750
the AI level because we

1422
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,015
use a lot of AI in this,

1423
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:54,230
but you're absolutely
right, you

1424
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,700
have to publish
the standards,

1425
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,360
you have to first of all,

1426
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,380
you got to write them.

1427
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,110
This is how every
network technology has

1428
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,840
gone out, in fact,

1429
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,860
Jonathan wrote
the ITF standard

1430
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,300
that now means

1431
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,335
you can type IPFS://

1432
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:13,790
into a browser and
it will work now,

1433
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,990
I forget what
that's called.

1434
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,890
I agree totally,

1435
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,000
you've got to write
those standards.

1436
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,110
We're going to
do part of that.

1437
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,490
You guys obviously you're

1438
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,900
the guys to do that.

1439
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,210
The big one and this
is one of our areas of

1440
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,400
innovation that's
in our patents,

1441
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,870
is as everybody has said,

1442
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,330
we need a unified naming

1443
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,690
and addressing scheme
that everyone can use.

1444
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,000
You're absolutely
right there's

1445
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,080
a whole bunch
of standards,

1446
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,070
so it's got to
be written here.

1447
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,915
The classic example with

1448
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:39,920
one of our advisors guy

1449
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,820
called Terry Personal,

1450
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,680
who was the guy who ran

1451
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,335
the project at CSIRO
that invented Wi-Fi.

1452
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:47,180
I know the
stories of fact.

1453
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,890
They solve the problem,

1454
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,150
they filed a patent and

1455
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,730
then they created
attitude at one.

1456
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,675
Terry and his guys
started the ADA to D21,

1457
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:59,150
it got adopted
by the IEEE.

1458
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,430
The IEEE sent them a
thing and said, Hey,

1459
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,110
do you have any
patents and will you,

1460
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,940
a, never sell them,

1461
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,420
b, give them away or c,

1462
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,130
sell them at a reasonable
price and they tick

1463
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,425
box C and the
rest is history,

1464
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,655
but absolutely,

1465
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:15,395
it's standards are
fundamental thing here.

1466
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:18,200
This is Everett
Rogers observability

1467
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,805
and compatibility pot,

1468
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:21,710
and it won't work
unless you do that

1469
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,380
but I think it's too much

1470
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:28,190
to try and change

1471
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,605
or retrofit, and
I think this is,

1472
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:35,210
some people have a problem

1473
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,545
with this of trying to

1474
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:39,935
graph TCPIP concepts into

1475
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:43,640
NDN to make it work
quote-unquote.

1476
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,470
I think I'm going to
have to keep them

1477
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,220
separate and you're going

1478
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,299
to build them
side-by-side.

1479
00:59:47,299 --> 00:59:48,785
It's the same thing
with the Internet.

1480
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,660
Day 1, 1969,

1481
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,680
there was no Internet, day

1482
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,495
2 there were four nodes,

1483
00:59:53,495 --> 00:59:56,045
and here we are day
whatever it is,

1484
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:57,620
and there's millions of

1485
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,465
them and that's
the process.

1486
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:00,740
Fortunately, it's a little

1487
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,260
easier, and thank you.

1488
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,450
My understanding is
that the NFD daemon is

1489
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,730
supported in Ubuntu
and that's like it's

1490
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,610
already on 400 million
servers. Job done.

1491
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,070
Just sighted people
plugging into that guys.

1492
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,315
That's what we're doing,

1493
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:18,770
so there are ways to

1494
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,470
do this that's
simplified for people,

1495
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,675
and this is the
fundamental thing.

1496
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:26,660
I always quote Paul Baron.

1497
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,890
Who invented
packet switching

1498
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:28,460
and he went to see

1499
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,370
AT&T in the 60s and
explained it to them,

1500
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,070
and the Chief Engineer
of AT&T turns to

1501
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,210
his guys and rolls

1502
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,200
his eyes to inspect

1503
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,310
to Paul Brandon and says,

1504
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,680
son let me tell you
how telephone work,

1505
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,810
it's a one person at

1506
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,940
a time conversation
to convert people,

1507
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,835
but you've got to try
and find that leverage.

1508
01:00:49,835 --> 01:00:52,220
Crazy guys like me and
the guys that we've

1509
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,800
found that just
get you there,

1510
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,825
and I had this
conversation with

1511
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:58,625
supposedly the head of

1512
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,140
finding new
technology at Akamai.

1513
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,820
Turns out he's the
guy who's in charge

1514
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,320
of killing new technology

1515
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,550
that might be a threat,

1516
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,725
and he said to me,

1517
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:08,540
he obviously is a
source of threat,

1518
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,440
and he said, how are you

1519
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,280
going to get it out there?

1520
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,810
At the time I said,

1521
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,880
given the Internet story
and he said, Yeah,

1522
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,130
but back then Akamai
didn't exist,

1523
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,515
and then quite had

1524
01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:20,900
cut back to him and
all the rest of it,

1525
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,285
innovator's dilemma etc,

1526
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:24,770
but it turns out

1527
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,855
Akamai's doing our
marketing for us.

1528
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:29,870
Does massive
failures recently,

1529
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,030
thesis is that the
Internet is too

1530
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,000
complex for human
beings to manage.

1531
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,780
We are going to fix that,

1532
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,590
and the only way to fix

1533
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,975
that is with some MLI.

1534
01:01:37,975 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm
writing because

1535
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,500
I'm trying to summarize

1536
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,330
10 years of
experience in pioneer

1537
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:46,760
in a shorter space
of time as I can.

1538
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,260
>> Maybe that will be

1539
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,760
a future tunnel system

1540
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,320
it up with we
are after all,

1541
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,610
being hosted at Nest.

1542
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,510
Maybe that could be

1543
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,130
a good topic
for the future.

1544
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,745
>> Yes, absolutely, and

1545
01:02:01,745 --> 01:02:03,485
thanks for the comments,

1546
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:08,810
and I think let's

1547
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,220
continue the
conversation even

1548
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,025
after the panel and
the conversation.

1549
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:15,900
Happy to reach out.

1550
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,220
I don't know if we're out

1551
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,260
of time or we have
10 more minutes,

1552
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,370
I'd like to have 10 more

1553
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,960
minutes if we have it,

1554
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,250
but I think the
last question

1555
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,970
I had was we started with.

1556
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,830
>> Excuse me, you
have 15 more minutes.

1557
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,370
>> Greta. Thank
you. We started

1558
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,350
with the community meeting

1559
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,185
with the goal of
creating a wish list.

1560
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,960
In terms of accessibility,

1561
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,870
what would be
your wish list?

1562
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,225
That goes to the panelist

1563
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,940
and then also
the audience.

1564
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,650
The panelist first.

1565
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,030
>> My wish list is
to have DevOps,

1566
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,580
if NDN engineers
working directly

1567
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,750
with me on my project and

1568
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,950
my wishes had
been granted.

1569
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,980
>> James, you mentioned

1570
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,349
a docker easy to
use applications.

1571
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:25,715
Is there anything else?

1572
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:29,100
>> Well, as I said,

1573
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,680
just creative ways to
increase exposure.

1574
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,140
I think one of
the problems

1575
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,830
with the half-century
existence

1576
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:44,300
of Internet and
precursor technologies

1577
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,025
is that everyone,

1578
01:03:46,025 --> 01:03:47,900
practically
everyone has grown

1579
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,630
up in the age of networks.

1580
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,305
There already is a
lot of conditioning,

1581
01:03:54,305 --> 01:03:56,270
specifically people
thinking they

1582
01:03:56,270 --> 01:04:00,410
understand how
networks work,

1583
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,885
and like I said this

1584
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:05,705
contributes to that
ossification problem,

1585
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:08,870
and so you have to
counter that and then I

1586
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:12,710
think any of the means

1587
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:14,075
that we've talked about,

1588
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:17,240
again, web accessible,

1589
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,630
single click Install,
very simple.

1590
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,985
Do It Yourself, Kits,

1591
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:26,450
I think are things
like mosquito, MQTT,

1592
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,130
things that there are

1593
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,825
hobbyists at
play with those.

1594
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:33,330
I don't hear of hobbyists
playing within NDN.

1595
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:37,415
I think one
important problem

1596
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,630
that I was not able to

1597
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:42,860
crack so far was you
need in aerospace,

1598
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,150
this is very important

1599
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,575
maybe and other sectors,

1600
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:47,000
you don't switch to

1601
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,250
something because it's
beautiful or elegant.

1602
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,155
You switch to something
because it has

1603
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:54,395
a concrete proven benefit,

1604
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,240
and so one of the things I

1605
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,235
wanted to do and I
was not able to,

1606
01:04:58,235 --> 01:05:01,010
or had not so far been
able to do was to

1607
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,190
create a benchmark suite.

1608
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,070
Well, so this would be
possibly a testbed,

1609
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:11,435
but a simulation
where we show,

1610
01:05:11,435 --> 01:05:14,495
I don't know, I'll
pick an example.

1611
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,970
Latency or energy where

1612
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,070
we demonstrate
concrete benefits.

1613
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,570
If I use an NDN
implementation,

1614
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:24,995
I gain x over an
IP implementation,

1615
01:05:24,995 --> 01:05:28,040
and I haven't heard
anyone talk about

1616
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,885
why from

1617
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:33,455
a measurable performance
standpoint NDN,

1618
01:05:33,455 --> 01:05:35,990
I think we have
ideas about how

1619
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:39,080
content based networks
can outperform,

1620
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,000
but that is how you sell

1621
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,215
things in

1622
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:43,970
certainly the
Department of Defense.

1623
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:46,610
That example I talked
about in the beginning,

1624
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,445
the mill standard 1553

1625
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:52,715
was adopted in
the F-15 program.

1626
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,070
Before that, believe
it or not, was analog.

1627
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,945
It was analog,
lots of wiring,

1628
01:05:56,945 --> 01:06:02,270
and the way that they
were able to sell 1553,

1629
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,500
which of course
now I'm saying I

1630
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,940
wish they would
get rid of because

1631
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,220
it's such an old
technolog the way

1632
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,270
they were able to sell it

1633
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,500
was they demonstraY.

1634
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,640
Ted white savings.

1635
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,990
We're talking
hundreds of pounds,

1636
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,490
and I think it was
mentioned earlier

1637
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,890
that wiring harnesses are

1638
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,740
a significant element of

1639
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,050
weight in systems
aerospace system.

1640
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,075
I know if one,
I think GPS,

1641
01:06:23,075 --> 01:06:25,040
I think it's rumored
that I want to

1642
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,590
say 400 pounds of

1643
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,410
wiring harness and or
kilograms and it's

1644
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:34,265
like $50,000 a kilogram
to launch something.

1645
01:06:34,265 --> 01:06:36,005
There was an incentive.

1646
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:39,080
When they were
able to say, Look,

1647
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,580
I can save you a lot of

1648
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,085
weight on the
F15 aircraft.

1649
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:45,590
If you switch
to the standard

1650
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:49,325
that put it over whatever
the tipping point,

1651
01:06:49,325 --> 01:06:52,460
and at that point,
since the F-15 did it,

1652
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,960
then the F-16 copied it

1653
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,525
and many other
systems copied it.

1654
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:58,700
That incentive
structure helps

1655
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,620
another question
about accessibility,

1656
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,215
but I think that
part of this is,

1657
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:05,025
what is the idea?

1658
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,925
The idea is elegant,

1659
01:07:06,925 --> 01:07:08,560
but why elegance that

1660
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,910
in itself is not enough.

1661
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,340
What is it that I
need to push us over

1662
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,360
the top? I'll stop there.

1663
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,300
>> Now, I think
that's a great point.

1664
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,395
It's the economy
of things.

1665
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:24,640
I think we need to have

1666
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,335
a panel on that as well.

1667
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,285
>> I just wanted

1668
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:31,830
to throw out
something quickly.

1669
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,675
Thinking into
what resources

1670
01:07:35,675 --> 01:07:37,805
made research
on the internet

1671
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,365
useful and valuable,

1672
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:41,150
one of them that I
don't think we've

1673
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,505
covered so far
is datasets.

1674
01:07:43,505 --> 01:07:44,660
There were a lot of

1675
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,130
datasets that were
collected over

1676
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,085
the internet that drove
a lot of research,

1677
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:51,320
the study of TCP
congestion control

1678
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,430
and lots of other things,

1679
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:56,285
and I don't think we
have NDN datasets.

1680
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:59,210
We don't have many
applications,

1681
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,620
but we do have some.

1682
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,290
We have climate,
we have genomics.

1683
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:06,185
Would it be
useful if people

1684
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:09,140
who run these
applications,

1685
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,270
if we collected some
data sets and made

1686
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,090
those available
to the community,

1687
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,590
may have to be a little

1688
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,315
different because
obviously there's

1689
01:08:17,315 --> 01:08:19,160
caching and this
retrieval from

1690
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,290
multiple locations
and so forth?

1691
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,449
But I wonder if
the availability

1692
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:24,830
of datasets something that

1693
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,925
a graduate student can
delay the hands-on in

1694
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:30,110
and look at India and

1695
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:33,680
studied and even some
an animation tool.

1696
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,090
I wonder if those
things would

1697
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:39,030
help propagate in the
end a little more?

1698
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,130
>> When we start
doing a lot of

1699
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,840
simulations on fabric,

1700
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,650
we could generate
that data

1701
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,560
in our genomics
experiments,

1702
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,475
I presume, if I understand

1703
01:08:50,475 --> 01:08:53,380
what data you're
talking about.

1704
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,100
>> Yeah. I have a couple
of comments on that,

1705
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,200
but let me see if there
are any questions or

1706
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,940
comments from the audience

1707
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,080
and then we'll
come back to that.

1708
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:11,140
If you have any questions
from the audience,

1709
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,590
feel free to
speak up, please.

1710
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:25,960
It doesn't look like
there are any questions.

1711
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,740
But this is also
going back to

1712
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,190
the testware
discussion and

1713
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,230
the docker discussion.

1714
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,965
Is it enough to have

1715
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:35,555
just a dataset or

1716
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:37,265
the testware or
the docker or

1717
01:09:37,265 --> 01:09:43,660
should we try to create
an example use cases

1718
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,935
where the genomic
students can go

1719
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:48,290
play with the data

1720
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,175
and the software
and the workflow?

1721
01:09:51,175 --> 01:09:55,030
The aerospace researchers
can go play with

1722
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:58,270
that particular set
of containers and

1723
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:03,100
so should we have

1724
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,490
distributed systems
that allows

1725
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,375
you to play with NDN,

1726
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:10,120
with actual data sets?

1727
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,960
>> Nothing beats having
the applications

1728
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,930
and play with the
applications themselves.

1729
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,150
But I was thinking
if there was

1730
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,750
a dataset where it

1731
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,660
demonstrated the
fact that you set

1732
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,810
an interest and then it

1733
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,220
takes so much time
to get it back,

1734
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,580
and then you send

1735
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,430
somebody else who has
an interest and they

1736
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,045
get it from a cache or

1737
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:33,845
showing things
like failover,

1738
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:35,110
some robustness
and so forth,

1739
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,780
I think those are simple
things that we could

1740
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:41,190
do that could demonstrate

1741
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,545
some of the
aspects of NDN,

1742
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:44,920
not everything, of
course, but some of them.

1743
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,110
>> Christos,
by dataset you

1744
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,110
also include the traffic.

1745
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,180
>> Exactly. Yes,

1746
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,340
I do want to see
that net flow traces

1747
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,210
that demonstrate
how NDN works.

1748
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,500
>> I'm saying
proof of evidence.

1749
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,125
Here it is we see,

1750
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,890
here's the real traffic,
it looks better.

1751
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,230
>> When we get started,

1752
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,640
we'll come back and

1753
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,900
talk to you,
Christos, about that.

1754
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,375
We'll generate
that for fabric,

1755
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,785
but also for the

1756
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:19,085
distributed Kubernetes

1757
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:21,660
specific research
platform.

1758
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,250
It's actually across

1759
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,020
the country now and we'll

1760
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,710
capture that
networking data

1761
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,660
and I'll make sure

1762
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,360
we capture the
right stuff.

1763
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,150
We're capturing resource
data just not at

1764
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,570
that granularity at
the network level.

1765
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:34,670
We're already
doing that for

1766
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,820
AI algorithms to predict

1767
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,975
our usage patterns in
the future so that we

1768
01:11:38,975 --> 01:11:42,160
can ask estimator
in the Cloud.

1769
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:51,270
>> I think we
are coming to

1770
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,885
the end of the time.

1771
01:11:56,885 --> 01:11:58,895
There's an eco somewhere.

1772
01:11:58,895 --> 01:12:01,300
I still want to see
once more if there are

1773
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,760
any questions or comments
from the audience.

1774
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,375
>> Final very quick
comment, Susmit.

1775
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,670
When we talked about

1776
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,530
standards, the other thing

1777
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,820
that I would
really like to

1778
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:24,555
see some work is,

1779
01:12:24,555 --> 01:12:27,910
what about putting
NDN in hardware?

1780
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,125
Are we not ready
yet or are there

1781
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:37,240
some basic simple
functionalities that we can

1782
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,445
define that can actually
get NDN in silicon?

1783
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,910
If we're not
ready yet, great,

1784
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:44,940
but I think having that

1785
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,870
conversation will
be interesting.

1786
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:55,050
>> I raised my hand,
I guess it's hard to

1787
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,815
see. Can people hear me?

1788
01:12:57,815 --> 01:12:58,885
>> Yes.

1789
01:12:58,885 --> 01:13:01,725
>> I was just typing
in my comments.

1790
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:05,530
Personally, I
believe the price,

1791
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:06,990
the selling points for

1792
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:11,790
NDN wouldn't be a
unique functionality.

1793
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,785
Being an old person,

1794
01:13:14,785 --> 01:13:17,485
being through the
old days of how

1795
01:13:17,485 --> 01:13:20,625
IP went over the world,

1796
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:24,925
performance wasn't
IPs strong points

1797
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:26,935
at the very beginning.

1798
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,650
I remember that my

1799
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:32,180
former advisor,
David Clarke,

1800
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:36,095
had to write papers
explaining to

1801
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:41,460
the world why TCP wasn't
intrinsically slow,

1802
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,230
rather just there is

1803
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,640
an early days of
implementation.

1804
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,255
Nobody is talking about

1805
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:50,780
TCP being too slow now,

1806
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,600
but in the early days,

1807
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,735
there's lots of
criticism about

1808
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:01,620
IPs, TCP/IPs poor
performance.

1809
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:06,235
I think that new things

1810
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:09,430
are not polished
and it's hard to

1811
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:12,505
beat the legacies
which has been

1812
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:18,645
debolished over the
package of deployment.

1813
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:22,055
That is just my
little thoughts on

1814
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:25,415
the competing and
performance front

1815
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:30,610
based on the past
observation. Thanks.

1816
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,890
>> Susmit, we
cannot hear you.

1817
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,860
>> Susmit, you're muted.

1818
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:06,639
>> He's unmuted but
just not talking.

1819
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,700
>> Looks like
we lost Susmit.

1820
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,240
>> Release the other.

1821
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,700
>> It's 2:15,

1822
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,340
so I guess its all time

1823
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:25,715
to end the law, I guess.

1824
01:15:25,715 --> 01:15:28,280
On behalf of Susmit,

1825
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,600
thank you-all
the panelists

1826
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,875
and the agenda has

1827
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,400
scheduled for a 15 minutes

1828
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,445
break starting now.

1829
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:39,875
Thank you very much.

1830
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:42,080
>> Thank you, Clemson.
